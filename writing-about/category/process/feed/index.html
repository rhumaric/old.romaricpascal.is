		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Though they’re probably what comes to mind most easily, lettering is not limited to analog supports (prints, signs, murals…). It can be used in website designs too. This medium brings new challenges, but also offers rewarding possibilities. A few of my latest projects have required me to draw letters that would later be embedded on a website. Here are a couple of things I’ve learnt along the way.<p></p>
<h2 id="pick-what-will-be-turned-into-lettering"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#pick-what-will-be-turned-into-lettering" name="user-content-pick-what-will-be-turned-into-lettering" aria-hidden="true"></a>Pick what will be turned into lettering</h2>
<p>Offline, you’d probably wouldn’t consider to hand-letter the whole content of a book or magazine. It’s much simpler and cost effective to only use lettering for headings and illustrations, and leave the bulk of the copy to be set with fonts.</p>
<p>This also applies on the web, but another constraint gets thrown in when picking which parts are good candidates for being lettered. Websites are live and their content gets updated regularly. It’s easy to change a message set with a font, but for text that has been hand-lettered not so much: a new artwork has to get drawn with the updated message.</p>
<p>This means lettering should be reserved for parts that are foreseen to remain the same throughout the whole life of the website. Or that will at least allow enough time for a new lettering to be produced before the update. Good candidates would be headings of the main sections, or supporting illustrations for example.</p>
<p>Art direction will have a big impact here. Choosing simpler styles, limiting decorations around the lettering will allow quicker production times. This could help to give some lettering love to parts of the design that will just get updated every now and then.</p>
<p>And maybe it’ll only be part of the design that will need regular editing. Lettering the static part while setting the editable bit with a font gives you the best of both worlds. An original rendering of the message and the ability to update what’s needed when the time comes.</p>
<figure>
<div class="o-ratio o-ratio--4:3">
<iframe src="/wp-content/uploads/demo/tedx-lettering-font/" style="border: none;"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="u-ta-c" style="padding: 0.5em;">Paired font and lettering for <a href="https://tedxbristol.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TEDxBristol</a> branding</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="then-be-even-pickier"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#then-be-even-pickier" name="user-content-then-be-even-pickier" aria-hidden="true"></a>Then be even pickier</h2>
<p>Once they’ve got that magazine in their hand, or they’re in front of a mural, viewers can enjoy the lettering instantly. Online, their device needs to download the content of the website before it can be shown to them.</p>
<p>Adding more images (which is what lettering is in the end), will add to the loading time, and <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow loading time drives users away</a>. So when planning a design that includes lettering, you’ll need to keep this loading time in mind to pick which parts get lettered. Especially as not everybody will be seeing the website with the comfort of a fast broadband.</p>
<p>But this quest for performance doesn’t just impact what will get the lettering treatment. It also impacts the assets that will be created: the lighter the files the better.</p>
<p>Picking the right file format will be really important. For artworks with clean lines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vector formats</a> will shine, especially as SVG is perfectly understood by the browsers. That said, if the artwork has rougher lines or some texture, rendering it to a JPEG or PNG might yield smaller files (and faster websites). This is for example what happened with the headings of this website.</p>
<p>And of course, you’ll want to keep the resolution of these artworks in check. No need to download an HD artwork if it’ll just be displayed in a 200px wide area.</p>
<h2 id="get-things-moving"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#get-things-moving" name="user-content-get-things-moving" aria-hidden="true"></a>Get things moving</h2>
<p>So far, the web seems to be mostly adding more constraints to the work. It also allows things that would just not be possible with printed/painted media.</p>
<p>Like adding animations and interactions to the lettering pieces. Inside a browser, the parts of the artworks can move around, fade in or out and react to user interactions. </p>
<figure>
<div class="o-ratio o-ratio--4:3">
<iframe src="/wp-content/uploads/demo/animated-heading/" style="border: none;"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="u-ta-c" style="padding: 0.5em;"><button class="rp-Button-naked rp-Link js-reloadIframe" data-target="[src=&#x22;/wp-content/uploads/demo/animated-heading/&#x22;]">Reload the demo and view the animation again.</button></figcaption></figure>
<p>Producing artworks for animation requires a bit more planning than a static image. Each part that will be animated need to be on its own so it can move independently from the other. And there’s of the course the design of the animation itself to do. But these animations can make the experience smoother and more engaging for users.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-responsiveness"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#embrace-responsiveness" name="user-content-embrace-responsiveness" aria-hidden="true"></a>Embrace responsiveness</h2>
<p>Websites also get viewed through a wide variety of screens: from small but tall phone in your palms to large and wide TVs in your living room. Depending on the design, this means the space allowed for the lettering might vary from one screen to another.</p>
<p>At best, it would be a simple change of resolution. But it can also mean different screen display different images entirely. Fortunately, lettering is about is adapting the message to the space available. So with a little effort and planning, it is entirely possible to create artworks that will adapt to the space given by the screen.</p>
<figure>
<div class="o-ratio">
<iframe class="rp-OrientableFrame rp-OrientableFrame-portrait" src="/wp-content/uploads/demo/responsive-heading/"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="u-ta-c" style="padding: 0.5em;"><button class="rp-Button-naked rp-Link js-rotateIframe" data-target=".rp-OrientableFrame">Change the space available to the demo and see how the lettering adapts</button></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s actually an exciting challenge to create something that will have to morph according to the space that it is given.</p>
<p>In the end one of the strengths of lettering is adapting the form of the message to its support. The web is just another one of them. For the new constraints it gives, it also opens the door to create animated and interactive pieces, helping to make your message even more memorable. Have you encountered beautiful lettering pieces nicely integrated in the design of a site? I’d be happy to <a href="/happy-to-chat">hear about them</a>!</p>

		<title>Designing TEDxBristol “Dare to Disrupt” branding</title>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->I was thrilled the TEDxBristol team chose me to design this year’s conference branding. For this edition, they were looking for something bold &#x26; edgy to match the “Dare to Disrupt” theme. And of course, a design linked to the city of the conference, Bristol. Here’s a behind the scene look at how the branding came to be.<p></p>
<p>Street art is big in Bristol, with plenty of walls covered in amazing graffiti. This felt a great match to link the branding to the city. For the other part of the brief, I needed to be sure we were on the same page regarding what “bold &#x26; edgy” meant before drawing anything. To validate the design would go in the right direction, I gathered <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/romaricpascal/inspiration-d2d/">some inspiration on Pinterest</a> to discuss with Nat who was managing the project for the TEDx team.</p>
<p>Now clearer on what matched (or didn’t) the theme, I could get sketching and quickly dismiss ideas that would have led nowhere. Things start really small first, with tiny sketches to explore different ideas rapidly. Calligraphy is also a big time saver at that stage: writing goes faster than drawing the outlines of the letters.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-745 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1024x576.jpg" alt="Exploratory sketches" width="1024" height="576" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-200x113.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-400x225.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-800x450.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Once I had a few options I was happy with, it was time to draw bigger and cleaner versions for presentation. A few main directions had emerged from the exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Energetic script lettering that would have sat well on a wall in Bristol (1 &#x26; 2)</li>
<li>A raised fist to encourage people to stand up and dare (3 &#x26; 4)</li>
<li>Playing on type contrast to emphasize the “disrupt” part (5 &#x26; 6)</li>
<li>A softer, more fun graffiti, in case the other were too harsh (7)</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-746 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Clean sketches for presentation" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-400x400.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-800x800.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1200x1200.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1600x1600.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>You’ll recognise the final branding is pretty close to option 1. At that stage, though, its letters were still a bit too soft. They needed a tougher feel. I felt it didn’t have enough of a graffiti feel, which led to the bold outline framing the “Disrupt” part.</p>
<p>With the shapes now pretty solid, it was time to look at colors and combination with the TEDx logo. There was one major constraint here: <a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/branding-promotions/logo-and-design/your-tedx-logo">the TEDx logo should only be used over a black or white background</a>. Problem solved with the white paint mark to contain both the graffiti and the TEDx logo. With it, the branding could be applied to a wider range of background.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-747" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1024x341.jpg" alt="Color options" width="1024" height="341" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1024x341.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-300x100.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-768x256.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-200x67.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-400x133.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-800x267.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1200x400.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1600x533.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>The initial ‘D’ mixed with the ‘i’ had some legibility issue though. One last redraw and it was time to create the final images. They would need to scale without blurring, so they adapt to whichever support they’re displayed on. This meant tracing the design into Illustrator, something I had delayed until now. To save time, all the color versions so far were <a href="/inking-and-scanning-lettering-artworks/">quickly inked scans</a> <a href="/processing-inked-artwork-with-photoshop/">colored in Photoshop</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/216681910" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/216681910">Part of the final vector tracing to create the branding (sped up 16 times)</a></p>
<p>In the end, the preferred background remained black, providing the boldest contrast with the white paint mark. It also provided added flexibility to put the TEDx logo inside or outside the paint, or even to not use the paint mark at all. “Disrupt” was made to stand out with a light-red tone that would sit well next to the TEDx logo.</p>

		<category><!--[CDATA[Process]]--></category>
		<category><!--[CDATA[Techniques]]--></category>
		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/inking-and-scanning-lettering-artworks/">The artwork is inked and scanned</a>, ready to be processed on the computer. Again, there’s plenty of ways to go for it. If the scanned artworks resolution is big enough for your end projects, Photoshop will do just fine to create your final image. Here’s the workflow I use most of the time. It which relies on fill layers and layer masks to make is super easy to pick colors for the final piece.<p></p>
<p>The process also focuses on working non-destructively, through masks, adjustments layers and painting on new layers. It would be a shame to mess things up after spending so much time sketching and inking the piece. Ctrl-Z will only go back so far, it’s safer this way. Plus this makes things more flexible.</p>
<h2 id="importing-the-artworks"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#importing-the-artworks" name="user-content-importing-the-artworks"></a>Importing the artworks</h2>
<p>First part is obviously bringing in the scans into your new Photoshop document (<em>File>Place</em> or just dropping them there). If you inked the artwork on multiple sheets (to separate the letters and their ornaments for example), you’ll need to set the upper layers blending mode to <em>Multiply</em> to make the white part transparent and let the lower ones appear through. Don’t forget to adjust their positioning if the scans aren’t quite aligned properly, and to mask out any part that had to be redrawn on another layer.</p>
<p>Once everything is there, the process can start. Depending on your artwork and how things overlap, you might have to repeat the steps for each of the layers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-667 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-replacement.gif" alt="Importing scans" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="black-white"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#black-white" name="user-content-black-white"></a>Black &#x26; white</h2>
<p>Layer masks are black and white images attached to a layer to control which part of it appears. White displays the corresponding area of the layer, black hides it (and grey values give some transparency). So the first step is to get our inked scans proper black &#x26; white, with values ranging from pure black to pure white.</p>
<p>This requires two layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/convert-color-image-black-white.html" target="_blank">Black and White</a> layer, that will convert the scan to greyscale. I usually just go with the <em>Auto</em> setting for this one.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/levels-adjustment.html" target="_blank">Levels</a> layer that will make sure the values go from pure black to pure dark. The graph shows the range of values on the image, black on the left and white to the right. Adjusting the toggles under the horizontal axis, you map the current values to a new range turning any value before the black toggle into proper black and any after the light one into proper white.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-671" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-bw-adjustment.gif" alt="Black and white adjustment" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="fix-details"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#fix-details" name="user-content-fix-details"></a>Fix details</h2>
<p>The scan might have some undesired imperfections (small dots of ink or unnoticed dust on the scanner window, misplaced stroke, lines not quite at the right angle…). Before going any further, let’s clean things up!</p>
<p>On a separate layer (to keep avoiding any unrecoverable damage), you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>cover small dots &#x26; imperfections with some digital <em>Brush</em> strokes</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/retouching-repairing-images.html" target="_blank">Stamp</a> tool to erase some misplaced stroke along the edges of a letter, while keeping the texture.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to moving things, cutting the area and pasting them on a separate layer to move it around is the most non-destructive method I could find. Probably worth working on a duplicate layer to keep safe.</p>
<p>If things don’t quite have the right size though, using the <em>transform</em> tool to stretch them (on a separate layer, again) is a risky business. It’ll alter the width of the strokes, which might make them look different than their neighbours. The <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/tutorials/7874" target="_blank">Puppet Warp</a> tool (and lots of patience) might save a trip back to the drawing board, but sometimes, it’s just best to redraw, re-ink and re-scan the part.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-for-masks"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#prepare-for-masks" name="user-content-prepare-for-masks"></a>Prepare for masking</h2>
<p>At this stage, the artwork is clean, with values ranging from pure white to pure black. Almost ready to be used as a mask for the fill layers.</p>
<p>To save time during inking, you can sometimes just trace the outlines and leave it to the <em>Paint Bucket</em> tool to do the filling. If that’s the road you took, it’s time to get these areas filled (as always, on a separate layer). It’s faster than covering with ink, but you don’t get paper texture or small “handmade” imperfections. Speed or texture, it all depends on what you’re after.</p>
<p>Often, a thin line will remain unfilled between you fill and the inked edge. Another go of the bucket tool will usually fill the gap. Also, if you’re artwork has inline inside letters, you might need to hide them while you create the fills to make sure the whole shape of the letter gets covered.</p>
<p>Last, the current artwork is black on white. If you remember the way layer masks work, this means all the inked part will actually be hidden. The opposite of what we need, so we need to invert the colors with an <em>Invert</em> layer.</p>

<p>It’s now time to take each element of the design onto its own fill layer, so we can easily adjust their color later.</p>
<p>How many layers depends on how you want things to look in the end. One per letter or line of ornament is definitely overkill (unless you intend each to have a separate color of course). One layer per elements you think will be of the same color might lack some flexibility to experiment getting some part of a different color. A good middle ground is one layer per word and “type of ornament”.</p>
<p>To prepare for the separation, I’ll create a fill layer, discard its mask and replace it by Alt-clicking the mask icon. This layer will serve as a base to duplicate and copy the parts of the artwork onto. The reason for this extra step is that new fill layers come with a “reveal all” mask (start all white). If you expand your canvas, this kind of mask will… well… reveal the new area and let it be filled with color. Usually not what’s needed, hence the replacement with a “hide all” mask.</p>
<p>From there, it’s a game of duplicating the layer, then selecting and copying on its mask whichever part of the prepared artwork is needed.</p>

<p>Let’s be honest, it’s quite a tedious part. But once it’s done, the fun can begin and you can easily adjust colors for each part of your design, add texture, easily duplicate layers to create a drop shadow, and whatnot to make it the final artwork.

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/paper-to-pixels-with-the-pen-tool/">The pen tool</a> is not the only way to turn a sketched artwork into a digital image. Especially, if you mean to keep a handmade feel and the texture of the letters over the paper, the smooth curves it makes work against you. In this situation, inking your artwork, scanning it and processing it in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> will be much better to retain those tiny details.<p></p>
<h2 id="inking"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#inking" name="user-content-inking"></a>Inking</h2>
<p>To make processing easy, I’ll need something with a clear contrast between the design elements and the background. Pencil usually doesn’t go dark enough, which is why the first step is inking the design.</p>
<p>A lot of work has been put into drawing everything right in the sketch. It would be terrible to lose all that because of an accidentally misplaced stroke of ink. So the inking is always done on a separate piece of paper: white paper, using a light-table to see the sketch, or just tracing paper, stuck in place with some painting tape or washi tape.</p>
<p>Actually, more often than not, inking needs to be done on multiple separate pieces of paper. Once on the computer, each part of the design will need to be isolated to be painted in a specific color. Inking on separate sheets help that process, making sure overlapping or close elements are easy to pick and color differently if needed (eg. letters on one sheet, decorations on the other).</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-635" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-dreams-big-sleep-ink.animation.gif" alt="Big dreams need big sleep - Inking steps" width="1080" height="764"><figcaption style="font-family: filsonsoft-bold; text-align: center;">Inking a design on separate sheets</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the inking itself, the sketch should be refined enough so it’s “just” a matter of tracing over it. Small fixes can still be made, but ink isn’t really forgiving, so best be super sure of what to change.</p>
<p>The tough part is obviously not going “all over the place wiggly” when tracing. Speed is an important factor: too fast and you lose control, but too slow and the pen has plenty of time to wiggle to the sides of the line. For this, a lot of focus and most of all practice is the only way to build up the precision &#x26; control of the pen… as well as not giving in to the temptation to rush it, especially when it gets towards the end.</p>

<p>Ink takes some time to dry, which means a risk of smudges. Going left to right, top to bottom is a good way to prevent them. This ensures your hand is always on an undrawn part (at least for right handed people, not quite sure how it’d work for a leftie, sorry). Protecting the paper from your drawing hand with another piece of paper is also effective when you had to ink stuff at the bottom or the right because of a super tall letter.</p>
<p>Best if there are no smudges, of course, but they’re not necessarily the end of the world. As the artwork is meant to be processed digitally, small smudges might be able to be erased. For bigger ones, redrawing is the only way. Luckily, going digital afterward means only the damaged part has to be redrawn.</p>
<p>Speaking of digital, that’s the next step: bringing each inked sheet onto the computer.</p>
<h2 id="scanning"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#scanning" name="user-content-scanning"></a>Scanning</h2>
<p>Most of the magic is done by the scanner here, but there are a few things to take into consideration there:</p>
<ul>
<li>size matters: If you intend to retain a handmade feel, and scan a large artwork to be displayed super small, bye bye texture details. Equally, if you scan something tiny to be printed at a large size, scaling up the design will look poor quality. So make sure the inked piece is appropriate for the size the final design will be used (I should probably have mentioned that before the inking).</li>
<li>scan at high resolution: the aim is to retain the handmade feel and ink on paper texture, so the more detailed a scan the better. In any case, if the final design is intended for print, providing an image with at least 300dpi (pixels per inch of paper you want to print) is best. So scanning resolution should at least match that.</li>
<li>scan in a lossless format: JPEG compression might introduce artifacts (blurry weird pixels). Best avoid them by scanning in a lossless format like TIFF. Bigger file size, but it makes sure everything is preserved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The processing will rely on a black and white scan of the inkings. I prefer leaving that to Photoshop as it gives more control over how pixels are turned to greyscale, but it’s worth experimenting with your scanner Black &#x26; White option if it has one.</p>
<p>Last, if you’re on the go and have no scanner, your phone might be able to save the day. If it has a decent camera, an app like CamScanner will be able to digitize your inked design at a good enough resolution (I managed to get an A4 300dpi image for <a href="/drawing-letters/570-2/">this artwork</a>). That said, deformations might occur when it straightens your image, so I usually prefer waiting to get back to a scanner (especially if multiple inked sheets need to align for the final design).</p>
<p>The inked artworks are now in the computer, ready to be worked on digitally. But that’s a topic of it’s own, which will get its own article soon. In the meantime, I’d be happy to hear if you have any questions regarding this article, or lettering altother. <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">Drop me a mail 🙂</a></p>

		<title>A few thoughts for my lettering practices</title>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Like any skill, the only way to get better at lettering is practice. Here are a few thoughts I try to keep in mind when practicing, so I make the most of each session.<p></p>
<h2>Plan, do, review.</h2>
<p>Time is limited, so I find having a purpose for the session super important. Both a topic to practice and a plan to practice it. Having them both planned out before the session is even better. It avoids losing precious minutes to “Hmm… what should I work on today? this? or maybe this? that perhaps?”.</p>
<p>Equally important is reviewing what happened at the end. It gives a nice boost to see what went well (high five!). But it’s also a time look at what still needs work (Rome wasn’t built in one day) and gather new topics to could use for the next practice.</p>
<h2>Slow down</h2>
<p>This one I struggle with a lot. Drawing nice letters takes time. It goes better with practice, but it’ll still take some time to pay the proper attention to details. Instagram &#x26; Youtube are full of accelerated videos making it feel that I’m never going fast enough. Not to mention some added pressure from having only so much time available to do it. But in the end, it’s practice time, and rushing through it won’t bring many results.</p>
<p>It’s more important to go at the right pace. If I’m trying to improve exploring different layouts by creating quick thumbnails, better be fast. But if I need to work on making my strokes more consistent, it might be best to slow down a bit. The right pace.</p>
<h2>Draw with intention</h2>
<p>Making quick half-thought through strokes on paper might turn into the letters I was hoping for… With a lot of luck. It’s not super repeatable and it doesn’t build up skills much anyways.</p>
<p>A much better option is to decide where to put the stroke and try and put it as best as I can. With this, I have a way to assess whether it went right or not, and think of ways to improve if it didn’t. I find it even more helpful to try to see the mark on paper before making it. It gives the pen(cil) a clear path to follow.</p>
<h2>Rehearse the movement</h2>
<p>It’s practice. Not every movement needs to mark a stroke on paper. Especially if the movement feels a bit unnatural, there’s no shame in rehearsing before putting the pen down. Drawing in the air a cm or so over the paper to get a feel for it before going for it. Or doing practice strokes on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<h2>Don’t think, just do</h2>
<p>All the steps above involve thinking, that’s true. But once the pen is on paper, there’s only one thing to focus on: making that mark. It’s practice, and it’s OK to make mistakes. Wondering whether it’s the right one for ages will only delay making it and waste time. Thinking of if I’m making it well enough just heightens the chances of interrupting the movement or making it shake. Both have their time, but not while making the mark.</p>
