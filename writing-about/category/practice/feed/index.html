		<description><![CDATA[<p>Whether with an actual brush or a brush pen, brush calligraphy is very versatile. It can be used to get a wide range of styles. You can make letters thick or thin, contrasted or not, with more or less texture… Great for exploring quickly different directions at the start of the project before refining the details by tracing over it. Here are a few pointers to get started.</p>
<h2><a href="#press-down-lift-up" name="user-content-press-down-lift-up"></a>Press down, lift up.</h2>
<p>This is what’s at the core of brush calligraphy. While following the shape of the letters, pressing the pen harder on paper when going down and releasing the pressure when going up is what gives a nice contrast to the strokes and consistency to the words. The harder you press when going down, the thicker the letters will be. And equally, the bigger the difference of pressure, the more contrast there will be between the down strokes and the up strokes.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-first-strokes" name="user-content-the-first-strokes"></a>The first strokes</h2>
<p>Most letters are built using a combination of a very little set of strokes. They’re a good starting point to get practicing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Downward stroke (for example, the start of ‘m’,’n’ or ‘r’). Going down, so putting pressure on the paper. Letters are most often slanted, leaning to the right. Depending on the style you want to give the letters, the angle will vary. What will be important is keeping this angle consistent from one stroke to another, as well as the width of the stroke.</li>
<li>Upward stroke (the start of a second type of ‘r’). Going up, you’ll want to put less pressure to get a nice contrast with the downward strokes. How little pressure is up to how contrasted you’d want the letters to be. The brush still needs to leave ink on the paper though 😉</li>
<li>Downward to upward (‘i’, ‘l’, ‘t’s, but also ‘u’s). A combination of the two previous strokes. As you get to the bottom of the downward stroke and turn upwards, you want to release the pressure gradually to get a nice transition between the thick and thin.</li>
<li>Upward to downward (the rest of the ‘m’ or ‘n’). The opposite of the previous stroke. It works pretty much the same, except you gradually increase, rather than decrease, the pressure while you get to the top of the stroke and turn downwards.</li>
</ol>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-526" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="305" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes.jpg 441w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-300x207.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-200x138.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-400x277.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></figure>
<p>Want to try your hand at it? Grab a rounded brush, a brush pen (the harder the tip, the easier to get started in my experience) or just any pen that would make thicker strokes the more you press, print this <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.empty_.jpg" target="_blank">empty lined worksheet</a> and you can start practicing your first strokes.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-first-word" name="user-content-a-first-word"></a>A first word</h2>
<p>Lines or strokes aren’t really the aim. Goal is to write letters &amp; words. Good thing is, with these 4 first strokes, you can already get writing. The word ‘minimum’ is great to practice without doing lines and lines of strokes. The added challenge here will be spacing. As with the thickness and contrast of the strokes, it’s up to you to play with it, but it’s important it’s consistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the ‘m’, ‘n’ and ‘u’ have a similar spacing inside them</li>
<li>that the letters have an even space around them.</li>
</ul>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-532 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="237" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum.jpg 665w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum-300x107.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum-200x71.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum-400x143.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></figure>
<h2><a href="#more-letters" name="user-content-more-letters"></a>More letters</h2>
<p>Not all letters are made of “vertical” strokes, though. To draw a full alphabet, there’ll be a couple more strokes we need.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Circular” strokes. They will help make ‘o’s, of course. And halves of the stroke will help draw ‘a’. ‘c’, ‘e’s and the bowls of ‘d’, ‘g’ &amp; ‘q’, and ‘p’ &amp; ‘b’. How circular depends on how wide your letters are. In most cases, you’ll want an ellipsis, more high than wide and slanted so it matches the other letters.</li>
<li>Loop strokes. Up then down for letters like ‘b’, ‘h’, ‘k’ &amp; ‘l’, and down then up for for ‘g’, ‘j’ &amp; ‘y’. The method is the same as for the up to down/down to up strokes above. As you start turning, you’ll need to start increasing/decreasing the pressure to transition gradually from thick to thin.</li>
</ol>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-535" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="399" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2.jpg 587w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2-300x204.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2-200x136.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2-400x272.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></figure>
<h2><a href="#letters-words-and-beyond" name="user-content-letters-words-and-beyond"></a>Letters, words, and beyond</h2>
<p>Combining all these strokes, you can attack writing various lowecase letters and start combining them into the words of your choosing. This other worksheet references all the lowercase letters to give you a starting point.</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-544 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.pangram.jpg" width="3507" height="2550" /></figure>
<p>From there, it’s all <a href="/a-few-thoughts-for-my-lettering-practices/">about practice</a>: write lots of letters and words. If you identify letters or combinations of letters that aren’t as the others, a line or two repeating those or writing lots of words containing them will be a good help improving.</p>
<p>Actually it’s not <em>all</em> about practice. It’s also about experimenting. With the size, the shapes, the curves, how thick, textured, contrasted, aligned you make the letters, try things out and see how they make the letter feel different. The internet is also full of references to study. Play around, have fun with it. And if you have any question, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">contact me and ask</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Like any skill, the only way to get better at lettering is practice. Here are a few thoughts I try to keep in mind when practicing, so I make the most of each session.</p>
<h2>Plan, do, review.</h2>
<p>Time is limited, so I find having a purpose for the session super important. Both a topic to practice and a plan to practice it. Having them both planned out before the session is even better. It avoids losing precious minutes to “Hmm… what should I work on today? this? or maybe this? that perhaps?”.</p>
<p>Equally important is reviewing what happened at the end. It gives a nice boost to see what went well (high five!). But it&#8217;s also a time look at what still needs work (Rome wasn’t built in one day) and gather new topics to could use for the next practice.</p>
<h2>Slow down</h2>
<p>This one I struggle with a lot. Drawing nice letters takes time. It goes better with practice, but it’ll still take some time to pay the proper attention to details. Instagram &amp; Youtube are full of accelerated videos making it feel that I’m never going fast enough. Not to mention some added pressure from having only so much time available to do it. But in the end, it’s practice time, and rushing through it won’t bring many results.</p>
<p>It’s more important to go at the right pace. If I’m trying to improve exploring different layouts by creating quick thumbnails, better be fast. But if I need to work on making my strokes more consistent, it might be best to slow down a bit. The right pace.</p>
<h2>Draw with intention</h2>
<p>Making quick half-thought through strokes on paper might turn into the letters I was hoping for… With a lot of luck. It’s not super repeatable and it doesn’t build up skills much anyways.</p>
<p>A much better option is to decide where to put the stroke and try and put it as best as I can. With this, I have a way to assess whether it went right or not, and think of ways to improve if it didn’t. I find it even more helpful to try to see the mark on paper before making it. It gives the pen(cil) a clear path to follow.</p>
<h2>Rehearse the movement</h2>
<p>It’s practice. Not every movement needs to mark a stroke on paper. Especially if the movement feels a bit unnatural, there’s no shame in rehearsing before putting the pen down. Drawing in the air a cm or so over the paper to get a feel for it before going for it. Or doing practice strokes on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<h2>Don’t think, just do</h2>
<p>All the steps above involve thinking, that’s true. But once the pen is on paper, there’s only one thing to focus on: making that mark. It’s practice, and it’s OK to make mistakes. Wondering whether it’s the right one for ages will only delay making it and waste time. Thinking of if I’m making it well enough just heightens the chances of interrupting the movement or making it shake. Both have their time, but not while making the mark.</p>
