		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->When thinking of responsive layouts, the first thing that comes to mind is probably width based media queries: (<code>@media (min-width:...)</code> or <code>@media(max-width:...)</code>. CSS provides other means to adjust your designs to the screen size. Viewport units, calc, height and aspect-ratio media queries‚Ä¶ these are just a few of them. Let‚Äôs see how they can be of help following the enhancement of a page I‚Äôve recently been working on.<p></p>
<h2 id="starting-point"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#starting-point" name="user-content-starting-point" aria-hidden="true"></a>Starting point</h2>
<p>The page in question is the <a href="/drawing-letters">artwork page</a> of my (soon to be)updated portfolio. Content-wise, there‚Äôs nothing too fancy. It‚Äôll obviously show a picture of the artwork. And provide a few additional things to complement it:</p>
<ul>
<li>a small caption (with a date of publication)</li>
<li>links to related pages (shop, project the artwork was for‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>a few other artworks to encourage discovery of content</li>
<li>social media share buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>To navigate through the artworks, the page also features previous/next buttons. And that‚Äôs it. Like I said, nothing crazy, which leads to the no crazier HTML markup:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/rhumaric/07b24a6779674b06fa55d6c4ba8158da.js?file=index.html"></script></p>
<p>With nothing more to control the layout, each block of content will just be stacked under the previous one and expand as the viewport‚Äôs width grow. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/responsive-layout-beyond-width-media-queries/starting-point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here‚Äôs how it looks</a>. Let‚Äôs see how we can improve on that!</p>
<h2 id="viewport-units-and-calc"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#viewport-units-and-calc" name="user-content-viewport-units-and-calc" aria-hidden="true"></a>Viewport units (and calc)</h2>
<p>First, we‚Äôll make some adjustments to the image. People get to this specific page to look at a picture. As the picture grows with the width, a limited height might come and crop it, only revealing the top part of the image at first.</p>
<p>Not an ideal first impression of the artwork, so let‚Äôs remedy to that and make sure the image is always visible in full. This means adapting its size to the height of the viewport, rather than the width, which is where viewport units come handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Viewport-percentage_lengths">Viewport units</a> are CSS length units that represent one percent of a size of the viewport:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vw</code> for the width</li>
<li><code>vh</code> for the height</li>
<li><code>vmin</code> for the smallest of these dimensions</li>
<li><code>vmax</code> for the largest</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <code>vh</code>, we can now limit the size of the image so it fits the screen perfectly. We need to account for the header at the top though, which steals some space (`3em`) from the full height (which would be 100vh). <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc">calc</a></code> to the rescue! It‚Äôll do the computation using the different units to account for that. While we‚Äôre reducing the size we might as well shave a bit more height to make sure the caption starts showing and entices the user to scroll and read it.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/rhumaric/07b24a6779674b06fa55d6c4ba8158da.js?file=viewport-units.css"></script></p>
<p>Good! Now whatever the screen, the image is always visible in full to start with. Let‚Äôs remember to add a link to a zoomed in version to let people look at the details too (but this part is not really about responsiveness, so let‚Äôs leave it out for now). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/responsive-layout-beyond-width-media-queries/viewport-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here‚Äôs the result</a>.</p>
<h2 id="height-media-queries"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#height-media-queries" name="user-content-height-media-queries" aria-hidden="true"></a>Height media queries</h2>
<p>As the height grows now, so will the image, and if the width of the screen allows it, it‚Äôll take the whole viewport if it can. This works well on small screens but feels a bit cramped past a certain width. Not to mention the line length of the caption growing past what‚Äôs comfortable for reading. Let‚Äôs improve that!</p>
<p>Playing with the width of the viewport (resizing the browser or using its responsive design dev tools), we can decide past which width things are breaking.</p>
<p>Then, usually, that‚Äôll be dealt with using a width media query: past a certain viewport width, set the <code>max-width</code> of the element to a fixed value. Our image size is adjusted to the height of the screen this time. This means we‚Äôll need to use a height media query (and not forget to add back the length we‚Äôre removing in the <code>calc</code>).</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/rhumaric/07b24a6779674b06fa55d6c4ba8158da.js?file=height-media-queries.css"></script></p>
<p>This makes things much nicer on a bigger screen. Win! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/responsive-layout-beyond-width-media-queries/height-media-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It looks like this now</a>.</p>
<h2 id="aspect-ratio-media-queries"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#aspect-ratio-media-queries" name="user-content-aspect-ratio-media-queries" aria-hidden="true"></a>Aspect ratio media queries</h2>
<p>That last adjustment gained us quite a bit of space (when available) on the sides of the content. This would be a much-improved place for the previous/next links, promoting navigation through the series of artworks.</p>
<p>The question is‚Ä¶ when is that space available? We‚Äôve got space when the overall width is more than the sum of the image width and the necessary width to put the two buttons: <code>min-width: &#x3C;image-width> + 2 * &#x3C;button-width></code>.</p>
<p>Like earlier, though, the viewport‚Äôs height is at play here, because of it‚Äôs relation to the content width. Our minimum width is actually: <code>min-width: (&#x3C;full-height> - &#x3C;reserved-spacing>) + 2 * &#x3C;button-width></code>.</p>
<p>It looks like another job for <code>calc</code>‚Ä¶ except <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media queries do not support <code>calc</code>ed values</a> üôÅ Fortunately, they do support a media feature that expresses a relation between the width and height: <code>aspect-ratio</code>. Rounding the previous sum into a ratio will not make things as precise, but will be enough to guarantee the space for small width.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/rhumaric/07b24a6779674b06fa55d6c4ba8158da.js?file=aspect-ratio-media-queries.css"></script></p>
<p>Great! When there‚Äôs enough space, people now get a quicker access to the navigation! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/responsive-layout-beyond-width-media-queries/aspect-ratio-media-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check it out</a>.</p>
<h2 id="combining-media-queries"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#combining-media-queries" name="user-content-combining-media-queries" aria-hidden="true"></a>Combining media queries</h2>
<p>Past the ‚Äúfixed width‚Äù breakpoint, the positioning of the navigation buttons breaks a bit. The buttons are displayed, but they grow further and further from the content as the height grows.</p>
<p>For large heights, also, the <code>aspect-ratio</code> query shows its limitations. As the height gets bigger, the query requires a larger and larger viewport width to be triggered. This makes viewports where there‚Äôd obviously been space for the arrows miss out on the enhancement.</p>
<p>At that point, the image size is set. We can just combine a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù <code>min-width</code> query to the <code>min-height</code> one to ensure the arrows will get displayed on screens with enough space, but not fitting the previous <code>aspect-ratio</code>.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/rhumaric/07b24a6779674b06fa55d6c4ba8158da.js?file=combined-media-queries.css"></script></p>
<p>And now that‚Äôs better! No more missing navigation when there‚Äôs space for it. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/responsive-layout-beyond-width-media-queries/combined-media-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And there we are</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#conclusion" name="user-content-conclusion" aria-hidden="true"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Further improvements could be made to the design (that unique column makes things look a bit empty at large width, for example). They wouldn‚Äôt rely on different mechanisms than the ones already described so let‚Äôs leave it there. Plus, that would spoil the surprise of unveiling the new design üòâ</p>
<p>These 4 CSS features have allowed us to get finer control on how the content would adapt to different viewports. I hope you‚Äôll find them useful if <code>min-width</code> or <code>max-width</code> don‚Äôt solve your layout problem. I‚Äôd be happy to hear how they worked for you, or if you use other features too to adapt your designs.</p>

		<title>Overlays with fixed positioning</title>
		<link>/writing-about/overlays-with-fixed-positioning/
		<pubdate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 13:09:24 +0000</pubdate>
		<dc:creator><!--[CDATA[romaricpascal]]--></dc:creator>
				<category><!--[CDATA[CSS]]--></category>
		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><code>position: fixed;</code> is a much older feature of CSS than <a href="/adding-visual-interest-with-css-grid-layout/">CSS grid</a>. Many patterns of modern web applications can be implemented with it, though. It is especially handy when something needs to get overlaid on top of the viewport, without changing <em>where it sits in the HTML</em>.<p></p>
<h2 id="a-different-kind-of-position-absolute"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#a-different-kind-of-position-absolute" name="user-content-a-different-kind-of-position-absolute"></a>A different kind of <code>position: absolute</code></h2>
<p>Like <code>position: absolute;</code>, <code>position: fixed;</code> removes the element it is applied to from the flow, collapsing the space it was due to take in the layout. It then positions it according to a combination of <code>top</code>/<code>bottom</code> &#x26; <code>left</code>/<code>right</code> offsets. The difference lies in according to what the element will be positioned. <code>position: absolute</code> uses the nearest ancestor whose <code>position</code> is not <code>static</code>. <code>position: fixed</code> uses the viewport, which is what makes it so handy to overlay things. On top of that, as the element is positioned according to the viewport, it‚Äôll stay in position as users scroll the content underneath it.</p>
<h2 id="dialog"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#dialog" name="user-content-dialog"></a>Dialog</h2>
<p>First thought when it comes to overlaying something is probably displaying a dialog for users to complete a small action. Let‚Äôs move the overlay to the center with:</p>
<pre><code class="css">.o-overlay--dialog {
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    tansform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
</code></pre>
<p>As we just specified two of the positioning offsets, the width and height will grow unconstrained, though. Super long words or a large amount of content might make things end up out of the viewport if we just leave it as is. To avoid that, let‚Äôs constrain the width and height a bit.</p>
<pre><code class="css">.o-overlay--dialog {
    /* ... */
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
    overflow: auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Voila! A dialog that can appear anywhere in the HTML and still be displayed at the center of the viewport, on top of the content.</p>
<p><iframe src="//jsfiddle.net/rhumaric/1zzfvfem/4/embedded/result,css,html/" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="cover"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#cover" name="user-content-cover"></a>Cover</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you might want to grab users full attention and cover everything. Without unloading the content that‚Äôs already there. Setting each offset to 0 will do just that (provided the element doesn‚Äôt have any margin).</p>
<pre><code class="css">.o-overlay--cover {
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    margin: 0;
    overflow: auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p><iframe src="//jsfiddle.net/rhumaric/1zzfvfem/5/embedded/result,css,html/" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="modal"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#modal" name="user-content-modal"></a>Modal</h2>
<p>Combining the two previous patterns, we can quickly get a modal window, which will prevent users from clicking/tapping the underlying content.</p>
<p><iframe src="//jsfiddle.net/rhumaric/1zzfvfem/6/embedded/result,css,html/" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="side-panels"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#side-panels" name="user-content-side-panels"></a>Side panels</h2>
<p>If you lose one of the offsets of the cover, you get side panels ready to contain a menu, additional side information or complex form controls. Depending on the content again, you‚Äôll want to restrict the height or width to make sure the content doesn‚Äôt just spread over everything. For a left panel, this becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="css">.o-overlay--panelLeft {
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  overflow: auto;

  max-width: 40%;
}
</code></pre>
<p><iframe src="//jsfiddle.net/rhumaric/1zzfvfem/7/embedded/result,css,html/" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 id="small-notifications"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#small-notifications" name="user-content-small-notifications"></a>Small notifications</h2>
<p>Add a bit of margin (or more offset) to a panel displayed from the top and you get a nice container for a quick notification. This would enable a form component to completely control the markup of its success message, while displaying where needed to attract some attention.</p>
<pre><code class="css">.o-overlay-toastTop {
  top: 1em;
  left: 1em;
  right: 1em;
}
</code></pre>
<p><iframe src="//jsfiddle.net/rhumaric/1zzfvfem/9/embedded/result,css,html/" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Playing with offsets, margins, and widths, you can get a wide variety of layouts. Vertical toolbars on the side of the viewport, chat windows popping from the bottom come to mind as other examples. These were just a few examples of how fixed positioning can help with some patterns found regularly in modern applications. While they surely could be implemented some other way, <code>position: fixed;</code> has this advantage of displaying things in a different place without touching the markup. A big plus when it comes to keeping things encapsulated. The markup for the modal window used by your custom form component can sit right inside that component, next to the <code>&#x3C;input></code> it enhances, rather than having to be appended some way to the <code>&#x3C;body></code>. As most techniques, it‚Äôs not a silver bullet, but it definitely comes handy. <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">Let me know what you think of it!</a></p>

		<category><!--[CDATA[Grid Layout]]--></category>
		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->If you‚Äôve wandered a bit on this website, you might have ended up on the page displaying my <a href="/drawing-letters">lettering works</a>. It displays a mosaic of my latest artwork entries. It‚Äôs basic layout is a grid of square images. It does the job, but it‚Äôs visually boring: all images have the same size, they‚Äôre all aligned neatly‚Ä¶ Having a bit of variation in the sizes of the images would make things a bit more interesting. Something like this:<p></p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;">
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-without-grid-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="767" height="618" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-501" style="max-width: 250px;" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-without-grid-screenshot.jpg 767w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-without-grid-screenshot-300x242.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-without-grid-screenshot-200x161.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-without-grid-screenshot-400x322.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px"><figcaption style="font-family: filsonsoft-bold; text-align: center;">Basic layout</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;">
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-grid-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="901" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-494" style="max-width: 250px;" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-grid-screenshot.jpg 765w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-grid-screenshot-255x300.jpg 255w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-grid-screenshot-200x236.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/css-grid-screenshot-400x471.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"><figcaption style="font-family: filsonsoft-bold; text-align: center;">Enhanced layout</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<h2><a name="user-content-maybe-you-see-it-maybe-you-dont" href="#maybe-you-see-it-maybe-you-dont" aria-hidden="true"><span></span></a>Maybe you see it, maybe you don‚Äôt</h2>
<p>Rather than using a JavaScript solution to position the images, the layout relies on a recent CSS specification: Grid layout. It leaves the maths for positioning the images to the browsers, following a spec‚Äôed algorithm that would work the same in each of them. </p>
<p>Not all browsers have implemented it yet, though. It means some people will see the nicer layout and others won‚Äôt. <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">That‚Äôs OK</a>. Everyone will see the images in a good enough layout. The Grid one just providing some final enhancement. And as browser support grows, more and more people will get the nicer one. Progressive enhancement FTW!!!.</p>
<p>So how is that Grid layout different from the other CSS layouts so far?</p>
<p>It lets the parent divide itself into rows and columns which will help position its children. By default, the first child would go into first cell, second child in the second cell‚Ä¶ But the grid layout lets you also pick where and how big the children will be displayed. Want the first child to be on the 3rd row, 4th column and span 2 columns wide? The Grid layout has you covered. The other children will then flow back from the first cell.</p>
<p>In practice, let‚Äôs see what happens to the <a href="/drawing-letters">artworks page</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="user-content-setting-up-the-grid" href="#setting-up-the-grid" aria-hidden="true"><span></span></a>Setting up the grid</h2>
<p>First, the <code>.rp-ArtworksList-grid</code> element gets divided into a regular grid on 128px squares (1/6th of the total container width).</p>
<pre><code>.rp-ArtworksList-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
  grit-auto-rows: 128px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>grid-template-columns</code> property defines how many columns there are and how big they are. If some columns are the same, the Grid layout specification profides a handy way to not type N times the same value with the nice <code>repeat()</code> shortcut. Additionally it introduces a new unit to define lenghts in ‚Äúfractions of the remaining space‚Äù, the <code>fr</code> unit. This makes dividing the width of the grid in 6 equal columns a piece of cake: <code>repeat(6, 1fr)</code>. </p>
<p>A corresponding <code>grid-template-rows</code> exists to set the height of the rows. However, grids can also be made to extend automatically, with two properties that let you define the size of new rows (and columns): <code>grid-auto-rows</code> (<code>grid-auto-columns</code>) properties. There‚Äôs an <code>auto</code> value that should adapt the height to the children. I couldn‚Äôt get it to work well in complement of the padding technique to fix aspect ratios. So hardcoded value it was üôÅ</p>
<h2><a name="user-content-positionning-the-children" href="#positionning-the-children" aria-hidden="true"><span></span></a>Positionning the children</h2>
<p>As it is, the grid is just a replica of the regulare square tiling. To add some visual interest, we still need to move some of the children in specific positions.</p>
<pre><code>.rp-ArtworksList_item:nth-child(1) {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: span 3;
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: span 3;
}

.rp-AtworksList_item:nth-child(2) {
  grid-column-start: span 2;
  grid-column-end: -1;
  grid-row-start: 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
}

...
</code></pre>
<p>The 4 properties <code>grid-column-start</code> &#x26; <code>grid-column-end</code>, and <code>grid-row-start</code> &#x26; <code>grid-row-end</code> define where the element will sit on the grid. You can define these either with row/column numbers, from the start (positive number) or the end (negative number) of the row/column. But you can also set over a span of how many rows/column they should be. This makes it a breeze to position the second big square at the end of the row, twice as big as the small squares, for example.</p>
<p>The layout only used a tiny part of the specification, but it got me really excited about having Grid layout available into more and more browsers. It obviously won‚Äôt be one to use for every layout (no need to roll a grid if you just line things up vertically), but it makes creating complex layouts way easier. For now, I‚Äôll keep it at hand for a final layer of enhancement, like on the <a href="/drawing-letters">artworks page</a>.</p>
