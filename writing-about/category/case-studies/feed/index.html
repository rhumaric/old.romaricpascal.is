		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->I was thrilled the TEDxBristol team chose me to design this year’s conference branding. For this edition, they were looking for something bold &#x26; edgy to match the “Dare to Disrupt” theme. And of course, a design linked to the city of the conference, Bristol. Here’s a behind the scene look at how the branding came to be.<p></p>
<p>Street art is big in Bristol, with plenty of walls covered in amazing graffiti. This felt a great match to link the branding to the city. For the other part of the brief, I needed to be sure we were on the same page regarding what “bold &#x26; edgy” meant before drawing anything. To validate the design would go in the right direction, I gathered <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/romaricpascal/inspiration-d2d/">some inspiration on Pinterest</a> to discuss with Nat who was managing the project for the TEDx team.</p>
<p>Now clearer on what matched (or didn’t) the theme, I could get sketching and quickly dismiss ideas that would have led nowhere. Things start really small first, with tiny sketches to explore different ideas rapidly. Calligraphy is also a big time saver at that stage: writing goes faster than drawing the outlines of the letters.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-745 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1024x576.jpg" alt="Exploratory sketches" width="1024" height="576" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-200x113.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-400x225.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-800x450.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-early-explorations-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Once I had a few options I was happy with, it was time to draw bigger and cleaner versions for presentation. A few main directions had emerged from the exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Energetic script lettering that would have sat well on a wall in Bristol (1 &#x26; 2)</li>
<li>A raised fist to encourage people to stand up and dare (3 &#x26; 4)</li>
<li>Playing on type contrast to emphasize the “disrupt” part (5 &#x26; 6)</li>
<li>A softer, more fun graffiti, in case the other were too harsh (7)</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-746 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Clean sketches for presentation" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-400x400.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-800x800.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1200x1200.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1600x1600.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>You’ll recognise the final branding is pretty close to option 1. At that stage, though, its letters were still a bit too soft. They needed a tougher feel. I felt it didn’t have enough of a graffiti feel, which led to the bold outline framing the “Disrupt” part.</p>
<p>With the shapes now pretty solid, it was time to look at colors and combination with the TEDx logo. There was one major constraint here: <a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/branding-promotions/logo-and-design/your-tedx-logo">the TEDx logo should only be used over a black or white background</a>. Problem solved with the white paint mark to contain both the graffiti and the TEDx logo. With it, the branding could be applied to a wider range of background.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-747" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1024x341.jpg" alt="Color options" width="1024" height="341" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1024x341.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-300x100.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-768x256.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-200x67.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-400x133.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-800x267.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1200x400.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1600x533.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>The initial ‘D’ mixed with the ‘i’ had some legibility issue though. One last redraw and it was time to create the final images. They would need to scale without blurring, so they adapt to whichever support they’re displayed on. This meant tracing the design into Illustrator, something I had delayed until now. To save time, all the color versions so far were <a href="/inking-and-scanning-lettering-artworks/">quickly inked scans</a> <a href="/processing-inked-artwork-with-photoshop/">colored in Photoshop</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/216681910" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/216681910">Part of the final vector tracing to create the branding (sped up 16 times)</a></p>
<p>In the end, the preferred background remained black, providing the boldest contrast with the white paint mark. It also provided added flexibility to put the TEDx logo inside or outside the paint, or even to not use the paint mark at all. “Disrupt” was made to stand out with a light-red tone that would sit well next to the TEDx logo.</p>

		<title>Case study: A logo for TaskFight</title>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="http://taskfight.romaricpascal.com">TaskFight</a> is a side project of mine. It’s an app that helps sort task priorities by pitching them against one another. Part of the project was designing it a logo that would make it stand out.<p></p>
<h2><a href="#constraints-inspiration" name="user-content-constraints-inspiration"></a>Constraints &#x26; inspiration</h2>
<p>Before any drawing begins, a few things needed to be laid down to make sure I got where I wanted.</p>
<p>Most important was how I wanted people to perceive the app. Sorting task priorities sound like serious business. I didn’t want it too far that way, if at all. I set for something more on the fun side, dynamic and bold. It’s dreadful enough having to figure out which task to work on next. Might as well make it a bit lighter.</p>
<p>I also needed to list of the constraints that would impact the design. Take the places the logo would be displayed, for example. A website header usually has limited height, which encourages a logo more long than tall. In other situations, the logo might have to fit an app icon or the favicon in the browser tabs. These constraints where important to make sure the designed logo was fit for use.</p>
<p>Based on these information, I gathered inspiration in a Pinterest board to identify design elements that would help convey specific aspects of TaskFight personnality. Contrasting, vibrant colors, bold type, dynamic lines, halftone testures, for example would be building blocks for an original logo for TaskFight.</p>
<h2><a href="#filling-white-pages" name="user-content-filling-white-pages"></a>Filling white pages</h2>
<p>I always start my lettering projects with pencil on paper. This make it really easy to quickly sketch different ideas, explore some further, without paying too big a “time price” for straying in a direction that won’t be used later.</p>
<p>So over the pages of my sketchbook, I explored different styles to give “TaskFight” the fun, dynamic and bold mood I was looking for.</p>
<figure class="&#x22;rp-Figure"><img class="alignnone wp-image-270 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles.jpg" alt="Exploring lettering styles for TaskFight logo" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles.jpg 1080w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-400x400.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exploring-styles-800x800.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"><br>
Style exploration sketches</figure>
<p>The fighting horizontal bars of the ‘F’ &#x26; ‘T’ felt a good concept to push further and refine into a final logo. The sketch left plenty of details to fix. After a few iterations, the letters were all tidy, ready to be digitized.</p>
<figure class="rp-Figure"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taskfight-refining-details.gif" alt="" width="800" height="600"><br>
Iterations to refine chosen direction</figure>
<p>The word was too bit to fit in an app icon on a phone screen, let alone in the minuscule favicon of a browser. That was one last problem to solve before going digital.<br>
While refining the logotype, I sketched a ‘TF’ monogram that would be perfect for that kind of space.</p>
<figure class="rp-Figure"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-275" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options.jpg 1080w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-400x400.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/monogram-options-800x800.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"><br>
‘TF’ monogram for small spaces</figure>
<h2><a href="#paper-to-pixel" name="user-content-paper-to-pixel"></a>Paper to Pixel</h2>
<p>A sketch on paper isn’t much use, so it was time to go digital and turn it into vector images I could embed in the app and its website. These would scale up &#x26; down nicely without pixelating and I could always export a bitmap if I needed.</p>
<figure class="rp-Figure">
<div class="o-ratio"><iframe class="o-ratio__content" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/187024021" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Digitizing the logo in Illustrator</p>
</figure>
<h2><a href="#colors" name="user-content-colors"></a>Colors</h2>
<p>The shape of the logo was complete, but black &#x26; white wasn’t really the feel I was going for. It was time to pick a color palette to make it a bit more energetic.</p>
<p>A bold and contrasting combination of yellow and dark purple would make it feel really dynamic. Associated to a red background and a halftone pattern, this would give a comic book feel adding a touch of fun to the whole.</p>
<figure class="rp-Figure"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-72" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/taskfight-screen-list.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="678" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/taskfight-screen-list.jpg 678w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/taskfight-screen-list-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/taskfight-screen-list-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/taskfight-screen-list-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/taskfight-screen-list-400x400.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px"><br>
