		<description><![CDATA[<p>Quite a few of the articles so far were dealing with the digital side of lettering. But what of the tools I use before getting to the computer? Here’s a quick overview of those.</p>
<h2 id="pencil-eraser"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#pencil-eraser" name="user-content-pencil-eraser"></a>Pencil &amp; eraser</h2>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-713 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-1024x532.jpg" alt="Lettering tools - Pencils, notebook, tracing paper and tracing paper" width="1024" height="532" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-1024x532.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-300x156.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-768x399.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-200x104.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-400x208.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-800x416.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-1200x624.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pencils-notebook-1600x831.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;">My most trusted tools</figcaption></figure>
<p>Feels like lettering is all about fancy pens, but a simple pencil (lead holder actually) and eraser are the tools I use the most. With only these, I can go from rough thumbnail sketches to a clean drawing ready to be traced on the computer.</p>
<p>For specifics, I’ve come to really like the feel of Rotring’s Tikky lead holders. As an eraser, I find Tombow’s Mono Zero sharp rectangular shape really handy to go for precise areas.</p>
<h2 id="a-support-to-write-on"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#a-support-to-write-on" name="user-content-a-support-to-write-on"></a>A support to write on</h2>
<p>Gotta make these pencil marks on something. Things usually start in my notebook, sometimes a spare sheet of printer paper, where I lay down rough sketches. From there, I build up the details iterating with tracing paper until I get a drawing clean enough for inking or digital tracing. At times the artwork needs to be transferred on a sheet of “nicer” paper and for this, a light table or carbon paper will come handy.</p>
<p>I prefer Leuchtturm 1917 notebooks to Moleskines. Their A5 format is slightly bigger and I find the ink doesn’t go through their pages as much (but maybe that’s just an impression). They’ve got a dotted version which is super useful getting things aligned properly from the early sketches.</p>
<h2 id="pens-markers"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#pens-markers" name="user-content-pens-markers"></a>Pens &amp; markers</h2>
<p>OK, fancy pens do have their use too. Left to right in the picture down below: Staedtler felt tip pens (various sizes), Pilot pocket brush pen (soft tip), Tombow Fudenosuke (soft &amp; hard tip), Sharpie, Uni ball white pens, Kuretake Sumi no8 &amp; 7, Pentel pocket brush pen, Pilot parallel pens (3.4 &amp; 6mm). I mostly use them for two things.</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-714 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1024x587.jpg" alt="Lettering tools - pen sample" width="1024" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1024x587.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-300x172.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-768x440.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-200x115.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-400x229.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-800x459.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1200x688.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1600x918.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;">A (small) army of pens.</figcaption></figure>
<p>First is inking the drawings before scanning when I want to keep a handmade feel. I started inking using felt tip pens, but I’ve grown to do most of my inking with Tombow Fudenosuke now (the blue one, with the hard tip). Took a bit of time to get a consistent stroke width, but I now find it handy to be able to vary it without changing pens. For super thin lines, I’ll still go back to a thin felt tip pen. And when I need really thick regular lines, a Sharpie marker does fine. For filling in big areas, the soft tip version of the Pilot pocket brush pen is ace.</p>
<p>The other one is calligraphy, which I do mainly as exploration before sketching (rather than to produce final designs). There is so just much choice for that, depending on the style you’re after:</p>
<ul>
<li>brush pens for modern script calligraphy (my favs: Tombow Fudenosuke, Kuretake Sumi, Pentel brush pen).</li>
<li>parallel pens (or automatic pens) for blackletter</li>
<li>nib holder (with a nib) &amp; ink for more classical &amp; thin script calligraphy</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a ruler of some sorts to draw straight lines, and that’s pretty much it. Out of the computer there&#8217;s plenty of other mediums to play with. Other artists are making inspiring experiments, whether it’s <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2322722-Sabra-Hummus-Ad">what they’re writing with</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdB4FBWb5QsG_kzn6UF1Ceus-HWkOXgpD">the support on which they draw</a>. Anything goes really, and there&#8217;s a few things I&#8217;m looking forward to experiment with like chalk, paint, cut paper to name a few. Stay tuned, maybe there&#8217;ll be a few poping up in the <a href="/drawing-letters">artwork section soon</a>!</p>
<p>Thought this list might be useful if you&#8217;re looking to start lettering and are wondering which tools to go for. If you have any question about it or anything else lettering related, <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">feel free to drop me an email</a>.</p>
