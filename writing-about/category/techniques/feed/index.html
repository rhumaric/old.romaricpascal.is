Every year for October, artists from all over the world take their pens &#x26; inks out to create one artwork everyday. Before taking part again, I looked back at the one I did for 2016 and picked my favorites! Here we go!<p></p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/paper-to-pixels-with-the-pen-tool/">Digitizing a lettering artwork with the Pen tool</a> can take quite a while. Fortunately, there’s a few things that can speed things up and get you quicker to a final piece.<p></p>
<h2 id="keep-handles-horizontal-and-vertical"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#keep-handles-horizontal-and-vertical" name="user-content-keep-handles-horizontal-and-vertical"></a>Keep handles horizontal and vertical</h2>
<p>Saving time on where to place the curves handles will yield big gains. Putting these handles down is most of what digitizing with the Pen tool is about after all.</p>
<p>A good way to go for it is to try and use horizontal or vertical handles as much as possible. This reduces the questions you have to ask yourself when placing the handles to “where is the curve tangent to a vertical or horizontal line?”. Only a few places on the curve answer that question, compared to basically anywhere on the curve if you consider “where can I put a handle at any angle?”. And these points are much easier to spot. Less questions, easier answers, faster tracing!</p>
<p>For some parts, you’ll even be able to stick to only one kind of handles (all horizontal or all vertical) and leave it to the Bezier maths to draw super smooth curves. But for other bits, there’ll be no other way than to put the handles at an angle (letter endings are a usual one). It’s OK, the aim is not 100% horizontal and vertical, but gaining time positioning most of the handles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-703 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles.jpg" alt="Handle positioning - Letters for good" width="741" height="741" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles.jpg 741w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-400x400.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px"></p>
<h2 id="loop-around-corners"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#loop-around-corners" name="user-content-loop-around-corners"></a>Loop around corners</h2>
<p>Another tricky point placement is when curves intersect one another. It can be tedious to eyeball the correct handle placement to get a sharp angle and keep both curves natural.</p>
<p>A trick for that is to leave it to the maths to compute the handles and anchor position. By drawing the curves past their intersection point, we can make sure the curves look right. Then once we’re done with the drawing, we can get rid of the lump(s) it created with the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/combining-objects.html">Pathfinder tool</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>first <em>Add</em> to make sure any lump inside the object get merged into it,</li>
<li>then <em>Divide</em> to split the curves where they intersect,</li>
<li>after which all that’s left is to delete the unnecessary bits.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/187024021" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/187024021">TaskFight – Tracing</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user57767932">Romaric Pascal – Web &#x26; Lettering</a>.</p>
<h2 id="split-it-into-multiple-curves"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#split-it-into-multiple-curves" name="user-content-split-it-into-multiple-curves"></a>Split it into multiple curves</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to want to draw the whole word in one curve, especially when digitizing script lettering where letters flow into the next one. This makes it harder to move letters later on to make small adjustments. Keeping letters, or even parts of letters (eg. the loop of a ‘d’ and it’s vertical bar), separate will make the editing afterward way faster. And once everything is all set, you can make it a unique shape with the Pathfinder.</p>
<h2 id="learn-the-shortcuts"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#learn-the-shortcuts" name="user-content-learn-the-shortcuts"></a>Use the shortcuts</h2>
<p>An obvious one to finish: software shortcuts are here to save time (it’s in their name). I’m not just talking about the ones to quickly change tools (<em>P</em> for the Pen tool, <em>A</em> for the Direct selection tool for editing drawn curves, <em>Shift + C</em> for the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/editing-paths.html#convert_an_anchor_point_precisely_using_the_convert_anchor_point_tool">Convert anchor point</a> tool, <em>+</em> and <em>–</em> to add &#x26; remove anchors…).</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll save time switching that way, but you’ll also gain time by not switching tools when drawing with the Pen tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shift</em>, while dragging the handles, will save you eyeballing if they are actually horizontal or vertical. It constrains the handles angle to multiples of 45°.</li>
<li><em>Ctrl</em> will give you quick access to the previous selection tool you had. Pick the Direct Selection one before the pen tool and you can quickly reposition misplaced points or adjust handles before getting back to putting that next point.</li>
<li><em>Alt</em>, before dragging a handle, will let you move it out of alignment with the other handle and create a sharp corner</li>
<li><em>Space</em>, while dragging the handles again, will switch to moving the anchor rather than the handles. It also works when using the Direct Selection tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this will help you get faster when digitizing your letters with the Pen tool. If you know any other trick I’ll be <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">happy to hear about them</a>. And as usual, if you have any questions about lettering, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">drop me a mail</a>.</p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/inking-and-scanning-lettering-artworks/">The artwork is inked and scanned</a>, ready to be processed on the computer. Again, there’s plenty of ways to go for it. If the scanned artworks resolution is big enough for your end projects, Photoshop will do just fine to create your final image. Here’s the workflow I use most of the time. It which relies on fill layers and layer masks to make is super easy to pick colors for the final piece.<p></p>
<p>The process also focuses on working non-destructively, through masks, adjustments layers and painting on new layers. It would be a shame to mess things up after spending so much time sketching and inking the piece. Ctrl-Z will only go back so far, it’s safer this way. Plus this makes things more flexible.</p>

<p>First part is obviously bringing in the scans into your new Photoshop document (<em>File>Place</em> or just dropping them there). If you inked the artwork on multiple sheets (to separate the letters and their ornaments for example), you’ll need to set the upper layers blending mode to <em>Multiply</em> to make the white part transparent and let the lower ones appear through. Don’t forget to adjust their positioning if the scans aren’t quite aligned properly, and to mask out any part that had to be redrawn on another layer.</p>
<p>Once everything is there, the process can start. Depending on your artwork and how things overlap, you might have to repeat the steps for each of the layers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-667 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-replacement.gif" alt="Importing scans" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="black-white"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#black-white" name="user-content-black-white"></a>Black &#x26; white</h2>
<p>Layer masks are black and white images attached to a layer to control which part of it appears. White displays the corresponding area of the layer, black hides it (and grey values give some transparency). So the first step is to get our inked scans proper black &#x26; white, with values ranging from pure black to pure white.</p>
<p>This requires two layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/convert-color-image-black-white.html" target="_blank">Black and White</a> layer, that will convert the scan to greyscale. I usually just go with the <em>Auto</em> setting for this one.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/levels-adjustment.html" target="_blank">Levels</a> layer that will make sure the values go from pure black to pure dark. The graph shows the range of values on the image, black on the left and white to the right. Adjusting the toggles under the horizontal axis, you map the current values to a new range turning any value before the black toggle into proper black and any after the light one into proper white.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-671" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-bw-adjustment.gif" alt="Black and white adjustment" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="fix-details"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#fix-details" name="user-content-fix-details"></a>Fix details</h2>
<p>The scan might have some undesired imperfections (small dots of ink or unnoticed dust on the scanner window, misplaced stroke, lines not quite at the right angle…). Before going any further, let’s clean things up!</p>
<p>On a separate layer (to keep avoiding any unrecoverable damage), you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>cover small dots &#x26; imperfections with some digital <em>Brush</em> strokes</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/retouching-repairing-images.html" target="_blank">Stamp</a> tool to erase some misplaced stroke along the edges of a letter, while keeping the texture.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to moving things, cutting the area and pasting them on a separate layer to move it around is the most non-destructive method I could find. Probably worth working on a duplicate layer to keep safe.</p>
<p>If things don’t quite have the right size though, using the <em>transform</em> tool to stretch them (on a separate layer, again) is a risky business. It’ll alter the width of the strokes, which might make them look different than their neighbours. The <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/tutorials/7874" target="_blank">Puppet Warp</a> tool (and lots of patience) might save a trip back to the drawing board, but sometimes, it’s just best to redraw, re-ink and re-scan the part.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-for-masks"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#prepare-for-masks" name="user-content-prepare-for-masks"></a>Prepare for masking</h2>
<p>At this stage, the artwork is clean, with values ranging from pure white to pure black. Almost ready to be used as a mask for the fill layers.</p>
<p>To save time during inking, you can sometimes just trace the outlines and leave it to the <em>Paint Bucket</em> tool to do the filling. If that’s the road you took, it’s time to get these areas filled (as always, on a separate layer). It’s faster than covering with ink, but you don’t get paper texture or small “handmade” imperfections. Speed or texture, it all depends on what you’re after.</p>
<p>Often, a thin line will remain unfilled between you fill and the inked edge. Another go of the bucket tool will usually fill the gap. Also, if you’re artwork has inline inside letters, you might need to hide them while you create the fills to make sure the whole shape of the letter gets covered.</p>
<p>Last, the current artwork is black on white. If you remember the way layer masks work, this means all the inked part will actually be hidden. The opposite of what we need, so we need to invert the colors with an <em>Invert</em> layer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-678 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-fixing-filling-inverting.gif" alt="Fixing filling and inverting" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="separating-the-parts-of-the-artwork-on-different-layers"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#separating-the-parts-of-the-artwork-on-different-layers" name="user-content-separating-the-parts-of-the-artwork-on-different-layers"></a>Separating the parts of the artwork on different layers</h2>
<p>It’s now time to take each element of the design onto its own fill layer, so we can easily adjust their color later.</p>
<p>How many layers depends on how you want things to look in the end. One per letter or line of ornament is definitely overkill (unless you intend each to have a separate color of course). One layer per elements you think will be of the same color might lack some flexibility to experiment getting some part of a different color. A good middle ground is one layer per word and “type of ornament”.</p>
<p>To prepare for the separation, I’ll create a fill layer, discard its mask and replace it by Alt-clicking the mask icon. This layer will serve as a base to duplicate and copy the parts of the artwork onto. The reason for this extra step is that new fill layers come with a “reveal all” mask (start all white). If you expand your canvas, this kind of mask will… well… reveal the new area and let it be filled with color. Usually not what’s needed, hence the replacement with a “hide all” mask.</p>
<p>From there, it’s a game of duplicating the layer, then selecting and copying on its mask whichever part of the prepared artwork is needed.</p>
<p style="max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto; text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-679" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split.png" alt="Each element on its layer" width="233" height="820" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split.png 233w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split-85x300.png 85w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split-200x704.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px"></p>
<p>Let’s be honest, it’s quite a tedious part. But once it’s done, the fun can begin and you can easily adjust colors for each part of your design, add texture, easily duplicate layers to create a drop shadow, and whatnot to make it the final artwork.

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/paper-to-pixels-with-the-pen-tool/">The pen tool</a> is not the only way to turn a sketched artwork into a digital image. Especially, if you mean to keep a handmade feel and the texture of the letters over the paper, the smooth curves it makes work against you. In this situation, inking your artwork, scanning it and processing it in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> will be much better to retain those tiny details.<p></p>
<h2 id="inking"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#inking" name="user-content-inking"></a>Inking</h2>
<p>To make processing easy, I’ll need something with a clear contrast between the design elements and the background. Pencil usually doesn’t go dark enough, which is why the first step is inking the design.</p>
<p>A lot of work has been put into drawing everything right in the sketch. It would be terrible to lose all that because of an accidentally misplaced stroke of ink. So the inking is always done on a separate piece of paper: white paper, using a light-table to see the sketch, or just tracing paper, stuck in place with some painting tape or washi tape.</p>
<p>Actually, more often than not, inking needs to be done on multiple separate pieces of paper. Once on the computer, each part of the design will need to be isolated to be painted in a specific color. Inking on separate sheets help that process, making sure overlapping or close elements are easy to pick and color differently if needed (eg. letters on one sheet, decorations on the other).</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-635" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-dreams-big-sleep-ink.animation.gif" alt="Big dreams need big sleep - Inking steps" width="1080" height="764"><figcaption style="font-family: filsonsoft-bold; text-align: center;">Inking a design on separate sheets</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the inking itself, the sketch should be refined enough so it’s “just” a matter of tracing over it. Small fixes can still be made, but ink isn’t really forgiving, so best be super sure of what to change.</p>
<p>The tough part is obviously not going “all over the place wiggly” when tracing. Speed is an important factor: too fast and you lose control, but too slow and the pen has plenty of time to wiggle to the sides of the line. For this, a lot of focus and most of all practice is the only way to build up the precision &#x26; control of the pen… as well as not giving in to the temptation to rush it, especially when it gets towards the end.</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;">
<div class="o-ratio"><iframe class="o-ratio__content" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/188295775" width="640" height="640" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><figcaption style="font-family: filsonsoft-bold; text-align: center;">Inking a design on separate sheets</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ink takes some time to dry, which means a risk of smudges. Going left to right, top to bottom is a good way to prevent them. This ensures your hand is always on an undrawn part (at least for right handed people, not quite sure how it’d work for a leftie, sorry). Protecting the paper from your drawing hand with another piece of paper is also effective when you had to ink stuff at the bottom or the right because of a super tall letter.</p>
<p>Best if there are no smudges, of course, but they’re not necessarily the end of the world. As the artwork is meant to be processed digitally, small smudges might be able to be erased. For bigger ones, redrawing is the only way. Luckily, going digital afterward means only the damaged part has to be redrawn.</p>
<p>Speaking of digital, that’s the next step: bringing each inked sheet onto the computer.</p>
<h2 id="scanning"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#scanning" name="user-content-scanning"></a>Scanning</h2>
<p>Most of the magic is done by the scanner here, but there are a few things to take into consideration there:</p>
<ul>
<li>size matters: If you intend to retain a handmade feel, and scan a large artwork to be displayed super small, bye bye texture details. Equally, if you scan something tiny to be printed at a large size, scaling up the design will look poor quality. So make sure the inked piece is appropriate for the size the final design will be used (I should probably have mentioned that before the inking).</li>
<li>scan at high resolution: the aim is to retain the handmade feel and ink on paper texture, so the more detailed a scan the better. In any case, if the final design is intended for print, providing an image with at least 300dpi (pixels per inch of paper you want to print) is best. So scanning resolution should at least match that.</li>
<li>scan in a lossless format: JPEG compression might introduce artifacts (blurry weird pixels). Best avoid them by scanning in a lossless format like TIFF. Bigger file size, but it makes sure everything is preserved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The processing will rely on a black and white scan of the inkings. I prefer leaving that to Photoshop as it gives more control over how pixels are turned to greyscale, but it’s worth experimenting with your scanner Black &#x26; White option if it has one.</p>
<p>Last, if you’re on the go and have no scanner, your phone might be able to save the day. If it has a decent camera, an app like CamScanner will be able to digitize your inked design at a good enough resolution (I managed to get an A4 300dpi image for <a href="/drawing-letters/570-2/">this artwork</a>). That said, deformations might occur when it straightens your image, so I usually prefer waiting to get back to a scanner (especially if multiple inked sheets need to align for the final design).</p>
<p>The inked artworks are now in the computer, ready to be worked on digitally. But that’s a topic of it’s own, which will get its own article soon. In the meantime, I’d be happy to hear if you have any questions regarding this article, or lettering altother. <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">Drop me a mail 🙂</a></p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Pen(cil) and paper make it easy to explore ideas, or even to get a pretty clean artwork. However, most projects need to go digital at some point, to prepare artworks for printing or create the logo files clients will be able to embed in their communications. There are a couple of different ways to do it, depending on the end result. One of them is tracing the image with a vector drawing software to create a vector image.<p></p>
<h2>Vector images &#x26; the pen tool</h2>
<p>Deep inside, vector images rely on maths. They define shapes &#x26; curves through lists of coordinates and then assign colors to fill or outline them (to simplify). This gives them this great advantage of scaling up and down nicely without getting blurry. Perfect choice for a logo, for example. Vector images are also perfect to get super clean curves. The maths don’t wiggle the pen while tracing the lines. Counterpart of that is that drawing something with more handmade and textured lines is trickier, though. Other techniques might be more suited if it’s the look aimed for.</p>
<p>Coordinates deep inside doesn’t mean we have to input them by hand, of course. Vector drawing software feature a pen tool to lets you trace the shapes. Illustrator is the industry standard, but solid contenders have appeared these past years: Sketch and Affinity designer. And there’s always the free Inkscape. The tool works in a similar way in each of them.</p>
<p>After importing a scan or straight picture in the background of your document, let’s see how the pen tool will help.</p>
<h2>Click! a point</h2>
<p>The pen tool works by placing the points of the shape every time you click. Click, a point. Click, a line. Click, the line continues… Until you get back to the start to close the shape. If you misplace a point, no worries. They can always be selected and moved individually later.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em; display: inline-block;">
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pen-tool-simple-clic.gif" alt="Pen tool example - Drawing straight lines" width="400" height="300"><br>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Great for angular letters made of straight lines, but that won’t help much when it comes to tracing smooth &#x26; curvy script letters.</p>
<h2>Curvy shapes</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the pen tool doesn’t just do straight lines and angles. If you click and drag the mouse while keeping the button down, the line will turn into a curve. The added point defines where the curve goes through. And new handles appear to control the curvature of the shape.</p>
<p>They’ll start in line with each other and of equal size. But the size of each can be adjusted separately to get finer control. And the angle between them two can also be changed, allowing to create sharp points when needed.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em; display: inline-block;">
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pen-tool-curve.optimized.gif" alt="Pen tool example - Drawing a curvy shape" width="400" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-591"><br>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At first, it’s tempting to add plenty of points along the curve. But actually the less points the better. The maths will always create a smoother curve than manually placing the points and their tangents. It also means fewer handles to adjust when needing to tweak the shapes.</p>
<h2>Drawing the line</h2>
<p>When the stroke’s width of each letter is the same, tracing the contours of each letter is counterproductive, though. Getting that width just right throughout each letter would take ages. For these, it’s faster to just trace a line along the letter shapes. Vector shapes are not limited to being filled with colors. They can have their outlines drawn, with control over how thick they are.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em; display: inline-block;">
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pen-tool-line.optimized.gif" alt="Pen tool example - Drawing a line" width="400" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-592"><br>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the end, it all comes to placing the points in the right place, with the handles of the right size. It takes a bit of practice, but I find it quite a relaxing part of the process, a bit meditative. It’s not just about “blindly” tracing over the sketch, though. This step is also one occasion to make adjustments to details that weren’t just quite right in the sketch. <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">Let me know what you think of this method,</a> and if you have any question, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">contact me</a>.</p>
