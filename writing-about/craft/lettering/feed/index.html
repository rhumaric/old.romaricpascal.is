Every year for October, artists from all over the world take their pens &#x26; inks out to create one artwork everyday. Before taking part again, I looked back at the one I did for 2016 and picked my favorites! Here we go!<p></p>

		<title>Lettering for the web</title>
		<link>/writing-about/lettering-for-the-web/
		<pubdate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 15:03:43 +0000</pubdate>
		<dc:creator><!--[CDATA[romaricpascal]]--></dc:creator>
				<category><!--[CDATA[Process]]--></category>
		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Though they’re probably what comes to mind most easily, lettering is not limited to analog supports (prints, signs, murals…). It can be used in website designs too. This medium brings new challenges, but also offers rewarding possibilities. A few of my latest projects have required me to draw letters that would later be embedded on a website. Here are a couple of things I’ve learnt along the way.<p></p>
<h2 id="pick-what-will-be-turned-into-lettering"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#pick-what-will-be-turned-into-lettering" name="user-content-pick-what-will-be-turned-into-lettering" aria-hidden="true"></a>Pick what will be turned into lettering</h2>
<p>Offline, you’d probably wouldn’t consider to hand-letter the whole content of a book or magazine. It’s much simpler and cost effective to only use lettering for headings and illustrations, and leave the bulk of the copy to be set with fonts.</p>
<p>This also applies on the web, but another constraint gets thrown in when picking which parts are good candidates for being lettered. Websites are live and their content gets updated regularly. It’s easy to change a message set with a font, but for text that has been hand-lettered not so much: a new artwork has to get drawn with the updated message.</p>
<p>This means lettering should be reserved for parts that are foreseen to remain the same throughout the whole life of the website. Or that will at least allow enough time for a new lettering to be produced before the update. Good candidates would be headings of the main sections, or supporting illustrations for example.</p>
<p>Art direction will have a big impact here. Choosing simpler styles, limiting decorations around the lettering will allow quicker production times. This could help to give some lettering love to parts of the design that will just get updated every now and then.</p>
<p>And maybe it’ll only be part of the design that will need regular editing. Lettering the static part while setting the editable bit with a font gives you the best of both worlds. An original rendering of the message and the ability to update what’s needed when the time comes.</p>
<figure>
<div class="o-ratio o-ratio--4:3">
<iframe src="/wp-content/uploads/demo/tedx-lettering-font/" style="border: none;"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="u-ta-c" style="padding: 0.5em;">Paired font and lettering for <a href="https://tedxbristol.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TEDxBristol</a> branding</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="then-be-even-pickier"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#then-be-even-pickier" name="user-content-then-be-even-pickier" aria-hidden="true"></a>Then be even pickier</h2>
<p>Once they’ve got that magazine in their hand, or they’re in front of a mural, viewers can enjoy the lettering instantly. Online, their device needs to download the content of the website before it can be shown to them.</p>
<p>Adding more images (which is what lettering is in the end), will add to the loading time, and <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow loading time drives users away</a>. So when planning a design that includes lettering, you’ll need to keep this loading time in mind to pick which parts get lettered. Especially as not everybody will be seeing the website with the comfort of a fast broadband.</p>
<p>But this quest for performance doesn’t just impact what will get the lettering treatment. It also impacts the assets that will be created: the lighter the files the better.</p>
<p>Picking the right file format will be really important. For artworks with clean lines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vector formats</a> will shine, especially as SVG is perfectly understood by the browsers. That said, if the artwork has rougher lines or some texture, rendering it to a JPEG or PNG might yield smaller files (and faster websites). This is for example what happened with the headings of this website.</p>
<p>And of course, you’ll want to keep the resolution of these artworks in check. No need to download an HD artwork if it’ll just be displayed in a 200px wide area.</p>
<h2 id="get-things-moving"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#get-things-moving" name="user-content-get-things-moving" aria-hidden="true"></a>Get things moving</h2>
<p>So far, the web seems to be mostly adding more constraints to the work. It also allows things that would just not be possible with printed/painted media.</p>
<p>Like adding animations and interactions to the lettering pieces. Inside a browser, the parts of the artworks can move around, fade in or out and react to user interactions. </p>
<figure>
<div class="o-ratio o-ratio--4:3">
<iframe src="/wp-content/uploads/demo/animated-heading/" style="border: none;"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="u-ta-c" style="padding: 0.5em;"><button class="rp-Button-naked rp-Link js-reloadIframe" data-target="[src=&#x22;/wp-content/uploads/demo/animated-heading/&#x22;]">Reload the demo and view the animation again.</button></figcaption></figure>
<p>Producing artworks for animation requires a bit more planning than a static image. Each part that will be animated need to be on its own so it can move independently from the other. And there’s of the course the design of the animation itself to do. But these animations can make the experience smoother and more engaging for users.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-responsiveness"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#embrace-responsiveness" name="user-content-embrace-responsiveness" aria-hidden="true"></a>Embrace responsiveness</h2>
<p>Websites also get viewed through a wide variety of screens: from small but tall phone in your palms to large and wide TVs in your living room. Depending on the design, this means the space allowed for the lettering might vary from one screen to another.</p>
<p>At best, it would be a simple change of resolution. But it can also mean different screen display different images entirely. Fortunately, lettering is about is adapting the message to the space available. So with a little effort and planning, it is entirely possible to create artworks that will adapt to the space given by the screen.</p>
<figure>
<div class="o-ratio">
<iframe class="rp-OrientableFrame rp-OrientableFrame-portrait" src="/wp-content/uploads/demo/responsive-heading/"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="u-ta-c" style="padding: 0.5em;"><button class="rp-Button-naked rp-Link js-rotateIframe" data-target=".rp-OrientableFrame">Change the space available to the demo and see how the lettering adapts</button></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s actually an exciting challenge to create something that will have to morph according to the space that it is given.</p>
<p>In the end one of the strengths of lettering is adapting the form of the message to its support. The web is just another one of them. For the new constraints it gives, it also opens the door to create animated and interactive pieces, helping to make your message even more memorable. Have you encountered beautiful lettering pieces nicely integrated in the design of a site? I’d be happy to <a href="/happy-to-chat">hear about them</a>!</p>

		<title>Designing TEDxBristol “Dare to Disrupt” branding</title>
		<link>/writing-about/designing-tedxbristol-dare-to-disrupt-branding/

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->I was thrilled the TEDxBristol team chose me to design this year’s conference branding. For this edition, they were looking for something bold &#x26; edgy to match the “Dare to Disrupt” theme. And of course, a design linked to the city of the conference, Bristol. Here’s a behind the scene look at how the branding came to be.<p></p>
<p>Street art is big in Bristol, with plenty of walls covered in amazing graffiti. This felt a great match to link the branding to the city. For the other part of the brief, I needed to be sure we were on the same page regarding what “bold &#x26; edgy” meant before drawing anything. To validate the design would go in the right direction, I gathered <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/romaricpascal/inspiration-d2d/">some inspiration on Pinterest</a> to discuss with Nat who was managing the project for the TEDx team.</p>
<p>Now clearer on what matched (or didn’t) the theme, I could get sketching and quickly dismiss ideas that would have led nowhere. Things start really small first, with tiny sketches to explore different ideas rapidly. Calligraphy is also a big time saver at that stage: writing goes faster than drawing the outlines of the letters.</p>

<p>Once I had a few options I was happy with, it was time to draw bigger and cleaner versions for presentation. A few main directions had emerged from the exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Energetic script lettering that would have sat well on a wall in Bristol (1 &#x26; 2)</li>
<li>A raised fist to encourage people to stand up and dare (3 &#x26; 4)</li>
<li>Playing on type contrast to emphasize the “disrupt” part (5 &#x26; 6)</li>
<li>A softer, more fun graffiti, in case the other were too harsh (7)</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-746 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Clean sketches for presentation" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-400x400.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-800x800.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1200x1200.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt.clean-sketches-1600x1600.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>You’ll recognise the final branding is pretty close to option 1. At that stage, though, its letters were still a bit too soft. They needed a tougher feel. I felt it didn’t have enough of a graffiti feel, which led to the bold outline framing the “Disrupt” part.</p>
<p>With the shapes now pretty solid, it was time to look at colors and combination with the TEDx logo. There was one major constraint here: <a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/branding-promotions/logo-and-design/your-tedx-logo">the TEDx logo should only be used over a black or white background</a>. Problem solved with the white paint mark to contain both the graffiti and the TEDx logo. With it, the branding could be applied to a wider range of background.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-747" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1024x341.jpg" alt="Color options" width="1024" height="341" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1024x341.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-300x100.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-768x256.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-200x67.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-400x133.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-800x267.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1200x400.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dare-to-disrupt-color-options-1600x533.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>The initial ‘D’ mixed with the ‘i’ had some legibility issue though. One last redraw and it was time to create the final images. They would need to scale without blurring, so they adapt to whichever support they’re displayed on. This meant tracing the design into Illustrator, something I had delayed until now. To save time, all the color versions so far were <a href="/inking-and-scanning-lettering-artworks/">quickly inked scans</a> <a href="/processing-inked-artwork-with-photoshop/">colored in Photoshop</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/216681910" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/216681910">Part of the final vector tracing to create the branding (sped up 16 times)</a></p>
<p>In the end, the preferred background remained black, providing the boldest contrast with the white paint mark. It also provided added flexibility to put the TEDx logo inside or outside the paint, or even to not use the paint mark at all. “Disrupt” was made to stand out with a light-red tone that would sit well next to the TEDx logo.</p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Since the invention of the printing press, it’s clear you wouldn’t hand draw each letter of a whole book. But from a single word to a sentence or two, there are other projects lettering is well suited for. Here’s a quick list.<p></p>
<h2>Logos &#x26; branding</h2>
<p>Lettering makes sure the shape of the letters really convey the values of your project/company. It’ll also help them fit well next to the symbol they might be attached to. And of course, drawing the letters is a necessary step if you’re looking for a monogram.</p>

<h2>Apparel &#x26; merch</h2>
<p>Whether for advertising an event or your company, or just as objects of their own, lettering can give apparel a lot of personality by making the message convey specific feelings. Other items can also provide a good support.</p>

<h2>Prints</h2>
<p>Posters, flyers, invites… a nice piece of paper with well-designed letters helps to get a message across and leave a memorable impact.</p>

<h2>Editorial illustration</h2>
<p>Nicely drawn letters on the cover of a book or magazine can give the readers a glimpse of what to expect and draw them in. Smaller illustrations can push forward key quotes from an article, whether along the text or as a heading.</p>

<h2>Chalkboards, murals &#x26; signs</h2>
<p>For these larger size projects, the medium dictates that the letters get drawn. There are not many other ways to list the menu of a restaurant on a chalkboard or to paint an inspirational quote on the walls of an office.</p>

<p>Of course, these are not the only things lettering can apply to. Cut paper, carved wood, food… lettering is not limited to ink, paint &#x26; pixels. And it doesn’t have to be limited to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7MFYoylVs" target="_blank">still letters either</a>. Did you see any original lettering piece lately? <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">I’d be happy to hear about it</a>.</p>

<p>Feels like lettering is all about fancy pens, but a simple pencil (lead holder actually) and eraser are the tools I use the most. With only these, I can go from rough thumbnail sketches to a clean drawing ready to be traced on the computer.</p>
<p>For specifics, I’ve come to really like the feel of Rotring’s Tikky lead holders. As an eraser, I find Tombow’s Mono Zero sharp rectangular shape really handy to go for precise areas.</p>
<h2 id="a-support-to-write-on"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#a-support-to-write-on" name="user-content-a-support-to-write-on"></a>A support to write on</h2>
<p>Gotta make these pencil marks on something. Things usually start in my notebook, sometimes a spare sheet of printer paper, where I lay down rough sketches. From there, I build up the details iterating with tracing paper until I get a drawing clean enough for inking or digital tracing. At times the artwork needs to be transferred on a sheet of “nicer” paper and for this, a light table or carbon paper will come handy.</p>
<p>I prefer Leuchtturm 1917 notebooks to Moleskines. Their A5 format is slightly bigger and I find the ink doesn’t go through their pages as much (but maybe that’s just an impression). They’ve got a dotted version which is super useful getting things aligned properly from the early sketches.</p>
<h2 id="pens-markers"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#pens-markers" name="user-content-pens-markers"></a>Pens &#x26; markers</h2>
<p>OK, fancy pens do have their use too. Left to right in the picture down below: Staedtler felt tip pens (various sizes), Pilot pocket brush pen (soft tip), Tombow Fudenosuke (soft &#x26; hard tip), Sharpie, Uni ball white pens, Kuretake Sumi no8 &#x26; 7, Pentel pocket brush pen, Pilot parallel pens (3.4 &#x26; 6mm). I mostly use them for two things.</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-714 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1024x587.jpg" alt="Lettering tools - pen sample" width="1024" height="587" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1024x587.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-300x172.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-768x440.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-200x115.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-400x229.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-800x459.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1200x688.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lettering-tools-pens-1600x918.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption style="text-align: center;">A (small) army of pens.</figcaption></figure>
<p>First is inking the drawings before scanning when I want to keep a handmade feel. I started inking using felt tip pens, but I’ve grown to do most of my inking with Tombow Fudenosuke now (the blue one, with the hard tip). Took a bit of time to get a consistent stroke width, but I now find it handy to be able to vary it without changing pens. For super thin lines, I’ll still go back to a thin felt tip pen. And when I need really thick regular lines, a Sharpie marker does fine. For filling in big areas, the soft tip version of the Pilot pocket brush pen is ace.</p>
<p>The other one is calligraphy, which I do mainly as exploration before sketching (rather than to produce final designs). There is so just much choice for that, depending on the style you’re after:</p>
<ul>
<li>brush pens for modern script calligraphy (my favs: Tombow Fudenosuke, Kuretake Sumi, Pentel brush pen).</li>
<li>parallel pens (or automatic pens) for blackletter</li>
<li>nib holder (with a nib) &#x26; ink for more classical &#x26; thin script calligraphy</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a ruler of some sorts to draw straight lines, and that’s pretty much it. Out of the computer there’s plenty of other mediums to play with. Other artists are making inspiring experiments, whether it’s <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2322722-Sabra-Hummus-Ad">what they’re writing with</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdB4FBWb5QsG_kzn6UF1Ceus-HWkOXgpD">the support on which they draw</a>. Anything goes really, and there’s a few things I’m looking forward to experiment with like chalk, paint, cut paper to name a few. Stay tuned, maybe there’ll be a few poping up in the <a href="/drawing-letters">artwork section soon</a>!</p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/paper-to-pixels-with-the-pen-tool/">Digitizing a lettering artwork with the Pen tool</a> can take quite a while. Fortunately, there’s a few things that can speed things up and get you quicker to a final piece.<p></p>
<h2 id="keep-handles-horizontal-and-vertical"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#keep-handles-horizontal-and-vertical" name="user-content-keep-handles-horizontal-and-vertical"></a>Keep handles horizontal and vertical</h2>
<p>Saving time on where to place the curves handles will yield big gains. Putting these handles down is most of what digitizing with the Pen tool is about after all.</p>
<p>A good way to go for it is to try and use horizontal or vertical handles as much as possible. This reduces the questions you have to ask yourself when placing the handles to “where is the curve tangent to a vertical or horizontal line?”. Only a few places on the curve answer that question, compared to basically anywhere on the curve if you consider “where can I put a handle at any angle?”. And these points are much easier to spot. Less questions, easier answers, faster tracing!</p>
<p>For some parts, you’ll even be able to stick to only one kind of handles (all horizontal or all vertical) and leave it to the Bezier maths to draw super smooth curves. But for other bits, there’ll be no other way than to put the handles at an angle (letter endings are a usual one). It’s OK, the aim is not 100% horizontal and vertical, but gaining time positioning most of the handles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-703 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles.jpg" alt="Handle positioning - Letters for good" width="741" height="741" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles.jpg 741w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-200x200.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/letters-for-good-handles-400x400.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px"></p>
<h2 id="loop-around-corners"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#loop-around-corners" name="user-content-loop-around-corners"></a>Loop around corners</h2>
<p>Another tricky point placement is when curves intersect one another. It can be tedious to eyeball the correct handle placement to get a sharp angle and keep both curves natural.</p>
<p>A trick for that is to leave it to the maths to compute the handles and anchor position. By drawing the curves past their intersection point, we can make sure the curves look right. Then once we’re done with the drawing, we can get rid of the lump(s) it created with the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/combining-objects.html">Pathfinder tool</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>first <em>Add</em> to make sure any lump inside the object get merged into it,</li>
<li>then <em>Divide</em> to split the curves where they intersect,</li>
<li>after which all that’s left is to delete the unnecessary bits.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/187024021" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2 id="split-it-into-multiple-curves"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#split-it-into-multiple-curves" name="user-content-split-it-into-multiple-curves"></a>Split it into multiple curves</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to want to draw the whole word in one curve, especially when digitizing script lettering where letters flow into the next one. This makes it harder to move letters later on to make small adjustments. Keeping letters, or even parts of letters (eg. the loop of a ‘d’ and it’s vertical bar), separate will make the editing afterward way faster. And once everything is all set, you can make it a unique shape with the Pathfinder.</p>
<h2 id="learn-the-shortcuts"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#learn-the-shortcuts" name="user-content-learn-the-shortcuts"></a>Use the shortcuts</h2>
<p>An obvious one to finish: software shortcuts are here to save time (it’s in their name). I’m not just talking about the ones to quickly change tools (<em>P</em> for the Pen tool, <em>A</em> for the Direct selection tool for editing drawn curves, <em>Shift + C</em> for the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/editing-paths.html#convert_an_anchor_point_precisely_using_the_convert_anchor_point_tool">Convert anchor point</a> tool, <em>+</em> and <em>–</em> to add &#x26; remove anchors…).</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll save time switching that way, but you’ll also gain time by not switching tools when drawing with the Pen tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shift</em>, while dragging the handles, will save you eyeballing if they are actually horizontal or vertical. It constrains the handles angle to multiples of 45°.</li>
<li><em>Ctrl</em> will give you quick access to the previous selection tool you had. Pick the Direct Selection one before the pen tool and you can quickly reposition misplaced points or adjust handles before getting back to putting that next point.</li>
<li><em>Alt</em>, before dragging a handle, will let you move it out of alignment with the other handle and create a sharp corner</li>
<li><em>Space</em>, while dragging the handles again, will switch to moving the anchor rather than the handles. It also works when using the Direct Selection tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this will help you get faster when digitizing your letters with the Pen tool. If you know any other trick I’ll be <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">happy to hear about them</a>. And as usual, if you have any questions about lettering, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">drop me a mail</a>.</p>

		<category><!--[CDATA[Photoshop]]--></category>
		<category><!--[CDATA[Process]]--></category>
		<category><!--[CDATA[Techniques]]--></category>
		<description><!--[CDATA[<p--><a href="/inking-and-scanning-lettering-artworks/">The artwork is inked and scanned</a>, ready to be processed on the computer. Again, there’s plenty of ways to go for it. If the scanned artworks resolution is big enough for your end projects, Photoshop will do just fine to create your final image. Here’s the workflow I use most of the time. It which relies on fill layers and layer masks to make is super easy to pick colors for the final piece.<p></p>
<p>The process also focuses on working non-destructively, through masks, adjustments layers and painting on new layers. It would be a shame to mess things up after spending so much time sketching and inking the piece. Ctrl-Z will only go back so far, it’s safer this way. Plus this makes things more flexible.</p>
<h2 id="importing-the-artworks"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#importing-the-artworks" name="user-content-importing-the-artworks"></a>Importing the artworks</h2>
<p>First part is obviously bringing in the scans into your new Photoshop document (<em>File>Place</em> or just dropping them there). If you inked the artwork on multiple sheets (to separate the letters and their ornaments for example), you’ll need to set the upper layers blending mode to <em>Multiply</em> to make the white part transparent and let the lower ones appear through. Don’t forget to adjust their positioning if the scans aren’t quite aligned properly, and to mask out any part that had to be redrawn on another layer.</p>
<p>Once everything is there, the process can start. Depending on your artwork and how things overlap, you might have to repeat the steps for each of the layers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-667 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-replacement.gif" alt="Importing scans" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="black-white"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#black-white" name="user-content-black-white"></a>Black &#x26; white</h2>
<p>Layer masks are black and white images attached to a layer to control which part of it appears. White displays the corresponding area of the layer, black hides it (and grey values give some transparency). So the first step is to get our inked scans proper black &#x26; white, with values ranging from pure black to pure white.</p>
<p>This requires two layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/convert-color-image-black-white.html" target="_blank">Black and White</a> layer, that will convert the scan to greyscale. I usually just go with the <em>Auto</em> setting for this one.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/levels-adjustment.html" target="_blank">Levels</a> layer that will make sure the values go from pure black to pure dark. The graph shows the range of values on the image, black on the left and white to the right. Adjusting the toggles under the horizontal axis, you map the current values to a new range turning any value before the black toggle into proper black and any after the light one into proper white.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-671" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-bw-adjustment.gif" alt="Black and white adjustment" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="fix-details"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#fix-details" name="user-content-fix-details"></a>Fix details</h2>
<p>The scan might have some undesired imperfections (small dots of ink or unnoticed dust on the scanner window, misplaced stroke, lines not quite at the right angle…). Before going any further, let’s clean things up!</p>
<p>On a separate layer (to keep avoiding any unrecoverable damage), you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>cover small dots &#x26; imperfections with some digital <em>Brush</em> strokes</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/retouching-repairing-images.html" target="_blank">Stamp</a> tool to erase some misplaced stroke along the edges of a letter, while keeping the texture.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to moving things, cutting the area and pasting them on a separate layer to move it around is the most non-destructive method I could find. Probably worth working on a duplicate layer to keep safe.</p>
<p>If things don’t quite have the right size though, using the <em>transform</em> tool to stretch them (on a separate layer, again) is a risky business. It’ll alter the width of the strokes, which might make them look different than their neighbours. The <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/tutorials/7874" target="_blank">Puppet Warp</a> tool (and lots of patience) might save a trip back to the drawing board, but sometimes, it’s just best to redraw, re-ink and re-scan the part.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-for-masks"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#prepare-for-masks" name="user-content-prepare-for-masks"></a>Prepare for masking</h2>
<p>At this stage, the artwork is clean, with values ranging from pure white to pure black. Almost ready to be used as a mask for the fill layers.</p>
<p>To save time during inking, you can sometimes just trace the outlines and leave it to the <em>Paint Bucket</em> tool to do the filling. If that’s the road you took, it’s time to get these areas filled (as always, on a separate layer). It’s faster than covering with ink, but you don’t get paper texture or small “handmade” imperfections. Speed or texture, it all depends on what you’re after.</p>
<p>Often, a thin line will remain unfilled between you fill and the inked edge. Another go of the bucket tool will usually fill the gap. Also, if you’re artwork has inline inside letters, you might need to hide them while you create the fills to make sure the whole shape of the letter gets covered.</p>
<p>Last, the current artwork is black on white. If you remember the way layer masks work, this means all the inked part will actually be hidden. The opposite of what we need, so we need to invert the colors with an <em>Invert</em> layer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-678 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/inking-fixing-filling-inverting.gif" alt="Fixing filling and inverting" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h2 id="separating-the-parts-of-the-artwork-on-different-layers"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#separating-the-parts-of-the-artwork-on-different-layers" name="user-content-separating-the-parts-of-the-artwork-on-different-layers"></a>Separating the parts of the artwork on different layers</h2>
<p>It’s now time to take each element of the design onto its own fill layer, so we can easily adjust their color later.</p>
<p>How many layers depends on how you want things to look in the end. One per letter or line of ornament is definitely overkill (unless you intend each to have a separate color of course). One layer per elements you think will be of the same color might lack some flexibility to experiment getting some part of a different color. A good middle ground is one layer per word and “type of ornament”.</p>
<p>To prepare for the separation, I’ll create a fill layer, discard its mask and replace it by Alt-clicking the mask icon. This layer will serve as a base to duplicate and copy the parts of the artwork onto. The reason for this extra step is that new fill layers come with a “reveal all” mask (start all white). If you expand your canvas, this kind of mask will… well… reveal the new area and let it be filled with color. Usually not what’s needed, hence the replacement with a “hide all” mask.</p>
<p>From there, it’s a game of duplicating the layer, then selecting and copying on its mask whichever part of the prepared artwork is needed.</p>
<p style="max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto; text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-679" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split.png" alt="Each element on its layer" width="233" height="820" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split.png 233w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split-85x300.png 85w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/layer-split-200x704.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px"></p>
<p>Let’s be honest, it’s quite a tedious part. But once it’s done, the fun can begin and you can easily adjust colors for each part of your design, add texture, easily duplicate layers to create a drop shadow, and whatnot to make it the final artwork. If you want to see how it looks like, here’s a (low res) <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/throw-me-the-money.process.psd">copy of the PSD file for my “Throw me the money” design</a>.</p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Pen(cil) and paper make it easy to explore ideas, or even to get a pretty clean artwork. However, most projects need to go digital at some point, to prepare artworks for printing or create the logo files clients will be able to embed in their communications. There are a couple of different ways to do it, depending on the end result. One of them is tracing the image with a vector drawing software to create a vector image.<p></p>
<h2>Vector images &#x26; the pen tool</h2>
<p>Deep inside, vector images rely on maths. They define shapes &#x26; curves through lists of coordinates and then assign colors to fill or outline them (to simplify). This gives them this great advantage of scaling up and down nicely without getting blurry. Perfect choice for a logo, for example. Vector images are also perfect to get super clean curves. The maths don’t wiggle the pen while tracing the lines. Counterpart of that is that drawing something with more handmade and textured lines is trickier, though. Other techniques might be more suited if it’s the look aimed for.</p>
<p>Coordinates deep inside doesn’t mean we have to input them by hand, of course. Vector drawing software feature a pen tool to lets you trace the shapes. Illustrator is the industry standard, but solid contenders have appeared these past years: Sketch and Affinity designer. And there’s always the free Inkscape. The tool works in a similar way in each of them.</p>
<p>After importing a scan or straight picture in the background of your document, let’s see how the pen tool will help.</p>
<h2>Click! a point</h2>
<p>The pen tool works by placing the points of the shape every time you click. Click, a point. Click, a line. Click, the line continues… Until you get back to the start to close the shape. If you misplace a point, no worries. They can always be selected and moved individually later.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em; display: inline-block;">
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pen-tool-simple-clic.gif" alt="Pen tool example - Drawing straight lines" width="400" height="300"><br>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Great for angular letters made of straight lines, but that won’t help much when it comes to tracing smooth &#x26; curvy script letters.</p>
<h2>Curvy shapes</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the pen tool doesn’t just do straight lines and angles. If you click and drag the mouse while keeping the button down, the line will turn into a curve. The added point defines where the curve goes through. And new handles appear to control the curvature of the shape.</p>
<p>They’ll start in line with each other and of equal size. But the size of each can be adjusted separately to get finer control. And the angle between them two can also be changed, allowing to create sharp points when needed.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em; display: inline-block;">
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pen-tool-curve.optimized.gif" alt="Pen tool example - Drawing a curvy shape" width="400" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-591"><br>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At first, it’s tempting to add plenty of points along the curve. But actually the less points the better. The maths will always create a smoother curve than manually placing the points and their tangents. It also means fewer handles to adjust when needing to tweak the shapes.</p>
<h2>Drawing the line</h2>
<p>When the stroke’s width of each letter is the same, tracing the contours of each letter is counterproductive, though. Getting that width just right throughout each letter would take ages. For these, it’s faster to just trace a line along the letter shapes. Vector shapes are not limited to being filled with colors. They can have their outlines drawn, with control over how thick they are.</p>

</div>
<p>In the end, it all comes to placing the points in the right place, with the handles of the right size. It takes a bit of practice, but I find it quite a relaxing part of the process, a bit meditative. It’s not just about “blindly” tracing over the sketch, though. This step is also one occasion to make adjustments to details that weren’t just quite right in the sketch. <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">Let me know what you think of this method,</a> and if you have any question, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">contact me</a>.</p>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Whether with an actual brush or a brush pen, brush calligraphy is very versatile. It can be used to get a wide range of styles. You can make letters thick or thin, contrasted or not, with more or less texture… Great for exploring quickly different directions at the start of the project before refining the details by tracing over it. Here are a few pointers to get started.<p></p>
<h2><a href="#press-down-lift-up" name="user-content-press-down-lift-up"></a>Press down, lift up.</h2>
<p>This is what’s at the core of brush calligraphy. While following the shape of the letters, pressing the pen harder on paper when going down and releasing the pressure when going up is what gives a nice contrast to the strokes and consistency to the words. The harder you press when going down, the thicker the letters will be. And equally, the bigger the difference of pressure, the more contrast there will be between the down strokes and the up strokes.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-first-strokes" name="user-content-the-first-strokes"></a>The first strokes</h2>
<p>Most letters are built using a combination of a very little set of strokes. They’re a good starting point to get practicing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Downward stroke (for example, the start of ‘m’,’n’ or ‘r’). Going down, so putting pressure on the paper. Letters are most often slanted, leaning to the right. Depending on the style you want to give the letters, the angle will vary. What will be important is keeping this angle consistent from one stroke to another, as well as the width of the stroke.</li>
<li>Upward stroke (the start of a second type of ‘r’). Going up, you’ll want to put less pressure to get a nice contrast with the downward strokes. How little pressure is up to how contrasted you’d want the letters to be. The brush still needs to leave ink on the paper though 😉</li>
<li>Downward to upward (‘i’, ‘l’, ‘t’s, but also ‘u’s). A combination of the two previous strokes. As you get to the bottom of the downward stroke and turn upwards, you want to release the pressure gradually to get a nice transition between the thick and thin.</li>
<li>Upward to downward (the rest of the ‘m’ or ‘n’). The opposite of the previous stroke. It works pretty much the same, except you gradually increase, rather than decrease, the pressure while you get to the top of the stroke and turn downwards.</li>
</ol>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-526" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="305" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes.jpg 441w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-300x207.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-200x138.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-400x277.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"></figure>
<p>Want to try your hand at it? Grab a rounded brush, a brush pen (the harder the tip, the easier to get started in my experience) or just any pen that would make thicker strokes the more you press, print this <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.empty_.jpg" target="_blank">empty lined worksheet</a> and you can start practicing your first strokes.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-first-word" name="user-content-a-first-word"></a>A first word</h2>
<p>Lines or strokes aren’t really the aim. Goal is to write letters &#x26; words. Good thing is, with these 4 first strokes, you can already get writing. The word ‘minimum’ is great to practice without doing lines and lines of strokes. The added challenge here will be spacing. As with the thickness and contrast of the strokes, it’s up to you to play with it, but it’s important it’s consistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the ‘m’, ‘n’ and ‘u’ have a similar spacing inside them</li>
<li>that the letters have an even space around them.</li>
</ul>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-532 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="237" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum.jpg 665w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum-300x107.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum-200x71.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.minimum-400x143.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px"></figure>
<h2><a href="#more-letters" name="user-content-more-letters"></a>More letters</h2>
<p>Not all letters are made of “vertical” strokes, though. To draw a full alphabet, there’ll be a couple more strokes we need.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Circular” strokes. They will help make ‘o’s, of course. And halves of the stroke will help draw ‘a’. ‘c’, ‘e’s and the bowls of ‘d’, ‘g’ &#x26; ‘q’, and ‘p’ &#x26; ‘b’. How circular depends on how wide your letters are. In most cases, you’ll want an ellipsis, more high than wide and slanted so it matches the other letters.</li>
<li>Loop strokes. Up then down for letters like ‘b’, ‘h’, ‘k’ &#x26; ‘l’, and down then up for for ‘g’, ‘j’ &#x26; ‘y’. The method is the same as for the up to down/down to up strokes above. As you start turning, you’ll need to start increasing/decreasing the pressure to transition gradually from thick to thin.</li>
</ol>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-535" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="399" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2.jpg 587w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2-300x204.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2-200x136.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.strokes-2-400x272.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></figure>
<h2><a href="#letters-words-and-beyond" name="user-content-letters-words-and-beyond"></a>Letters, words, and beyond</h2>
<p>Combining all these strokes, you can attack writing various lowecase letters and start combining them into the words of your choosing. This other worksheet references all the lowercase letters to give you a starting point.</p>
<figure style="border: solid 1px currentColor; padding: 1em;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-544 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lettering-brush-basics.pangram.jpg" width="3507" height="2550"></figure>
<p>From there, it’s all <a href="/a-few-thoughts-for-my-lettering-practices/">about practice</a>: write lots of letters and words. If you identify letters or combinations of letters that aren’t as the others, a line or two repeating those or writing lots of words containing them will be a good help improving.</p>
<p>Actually it’s not <em>all</em> about practice. It’s also about experimenting. With the size, the shapes, the curves, how thick, textured, contrasted, aligned you make the letters, try things out and see how they make the letter feel different. The internet is also full of references to study. Play around, have fun with it. And if you have any question, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@romaricpascal.is">contact me and ask</a>.</p>

		<title>A few thoughts for my lettering practices</title>

		<description><!--[CDATA[<p-->Like any skill, the only way to get better at lettering is practice. Here are a few thoughts I try to keep in mind when practicing, so I make the most of each session.<p></p>
<h2>Plan, do, review.</h2>
<p>Time is limited, so I find having a purpose for the session super important. Both a topic to practice and a plan to practice it. Having them both planned out before the session is even better. It avoids losing precious minutes to “Hmm… what should I work on today? this? or maybe this? that perhaps?”.</p>
<p>Equally important is reviewing what happened at the end. It gives a nice boost to see what went well (high five!). But it’s also a time look at what still needs work (Rome wasn’t built in one day) and gather new topics to could use for the next practice.</p>
<h2>Slow down</h2>
<p>This one I struggle with a lot. Drawing nice letters takes time. It goes better with practice, but it’ll still take some time to pay the proper attention to details. Instagram &#x26; Youtube are full of accelerated videos making it feel that I’m never going fast enough. Not to mention some added pressure from having only so much time available to do it. But in the end, it’s practice time, and rushing through it won’t bring many results.</p>
<p>It’s more important to go at the right pace. If I’m trying to improve exploring different layouts by creating quick thumbnails, better be fast. But if I need to work on making my strokes more consistent, it might be best to slow down a bit. The right pace.</p>
<h2>Draw with intention</h2>
<p>Making quick half-thought through strokes on paper might turn into the letters I was hoping for… With a lot of luck. It’s not super repeatable and it doesn’t build up skills much anyways.</p>
<p>A much better option is to decide where to put the stroke and try and put it as best as I can. With this, I have a way to assess whether it went right or not, and think of ways to improve if it didn’t. I find it even more helpful to try to see the mark on paper before making it. It gives the pen(cil) a clear path to follow.</p>
<h2>Rehearse the movement</h2>
<p>It’s practice. Not every movement needs to mark a stroke on paper. Especially if the movement feels a bit unnatural, there’s no shame in rehearsing before putting the pen down. Drawing in the air a cm or so over the paper to get a feel for it before going for it. Or doing practice strokes on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
<h2>Don’t think, just do</h2>
<p>All the steps above involve thinking, that’s true. But once the pen is on paper, there’s only one thing to focus on: making that mark. It’s practice, and it’s OK to make mistakes. Wondering whether it’s the right one for ages will only delay making it and waste time. Thinking of if I’m making it well enough just heightens the chances of interrupting the movement or making it shake. Both have their time, but not while making the mark.</p>
